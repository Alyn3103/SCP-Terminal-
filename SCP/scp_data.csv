1,,6,"SCP-001 consists of several proposals as to what 001 truly is. According to GENERAL NOTICE 001-Alpha, various files were fabricated to prevent leaks of the true proposals. Its entry in SCiPnet is protected by the Berryman-Langford memetic kill agent, which results in immediate cardiac arrest upon viewing it without proper inoculation.",https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/scp-db/images/c/c3/Berryman-Langford.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220831153519,,,,,,,https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/scp-db/images/c/c3/Berryman-Langford.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20220831153519
2,Euclid,2," SCP-002 resembles a tumorous, fleshy growth with a volume of roughly 60 m³ (or 2000 ft³). An iron valve hatch on one side leads to its interior, which appears to be a standard low-rent apartment of modest size. One wall of the room possesses a single window, though no such opening is visible from the exterior. The room contains furniture which, upon close examination, appears to be sculpted bone, woven hair, and various other biological substances produced by the human body. All matter tested thus far show independent or fragmented DNA sequences for each object in the room.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-002/800px-SCP002-new.jpg,,,,,,,
3,Euclid,2," SCP-003 consists of two related components of separate origin, referred to as SCP-003-1 and SCP-003-2.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-003/SCP-003a-new.jpg,,,,,,,
4,Euclid,2, SCP-004 consists of an old wooden barn door (SCP-004-1) and a set of twelve rusted steel keys (SCP-004-2 through SCP-004-13). The door itself is the entrance to an abandoned factory in [DATA EXPUNGED].,https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-004/SCP004_door-new.jpg,,,,,,,
5,Safe,1," In appearance, SCP-005 resembles an ornate key, displaying the characteristics of a typical mass produced key used in the 1920s. The key was discovered when a civilian used it to infiltrate a high security facility. SCP-005 seems to have the unique ability to open any and all forms of lock (See Appendix A), be they mechanical or digital, with relative ease. The origin of this ability has yet to be determined.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-005/SCP-005.jpg,,,,,,,
6,Safe,1," SCP-006 is a very small spring located 60 km west of Astrakhan. Foundation Command was aware of its existence since the 19th century, but were unable to secure it until 1991 due to political reasons. On the spot of the spring, a chemical factory has been constructed as a disguise, with the majority of laborers under Foundation and/or Russian control. The liquid emitted from the spring has been chemically identified as simple mineral water in 1902, but has the unusual property of ""health"".",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-006/SCP006_stream-new.jpg,,,,,,,
7,Euclid,2," SCP-007 is located within a cavity in the abdomen of Subject. Subject is a Caucasian male, physically approximately 25 years of age (subject claims to be 28) and 176 cm in height. Most of Subject's abdomen (muscles, skin, and organs) is absent, though Subject does not appear to suffer because of this. Instead of normal flesh, a sphere composed of soil and water is present, though it does not actually come into contact with Subject's body at any point. The sphere appears to be, in most respects, a miniature near-duplicate of the Earth, approximately 60 cm in diameter, although continental alignment is not consistent with that of any alignment known in Earth's history. The sphere has its own weather patterns and negligible gravitational pull, in addition to microscopic organisms somewhat resembling those of modern-day Earth inhabiting it. Two intelligent species have been observed, though contact and communication with either has yet to be made. Technology levels of observed species must be checked at least once a week and, as of ¦¦/¦¦¦¦, are approximately equal to that of 15th-Century Earth.",,,,,,,,
8,Euclid,2," SCP-008 is a complex prion, samples of which are stored in each of the known G2 sites. Research into SCP-008 is highly classified and primarily aimed at preventing research which may lead to the synthesis of SCP-008 in the distant future. Traits of the SCP-008 prion include:",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-008/scp-008.png,,,,,,,
9,Euclid,2," SCP-009 is approximately ¦¦¦ liters of a substance which superficially resembles distilled water (H 2 O), except with a distinct bright red hue. This red hue is discernible in all phases, and serves as the most expedient method of identifying contaminated matter before its anomalous properties manifest. In contrast to mundane water, SCP-009 assumes a liquid phase at temperatures between -100°C and 0°C, and a solid state above those temperatures. At temperatures below -100°C, SCP-009 vaporizes into a gaseous phase similar to steam.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-009/009.png,,,,,,,
10,Safe,1," SCP-010 consists of a series of six (6) apparently identical cast iron collars with numbered metal tags and one (1) remote control. The control is SCP-010-1. The collars are SCP-010-2 through 010-7. The collars contain intricate electronic components and are powered by small (5 mm diameter, 2 mm thick) 100 V batteries. These batteries are rechargeable.",,,,,,,,
11,Safe,1," SCP-011 is a Civil War memorial statue located in Woodstock, Vermont. The statue is the image of a young male soldier holding a musket at his side, and is carved out of granite quarried within the area. Occasionally, SCP-011 has been observed lifting its musket to the sky to fire at birds which attempt to land or defecate on it. Reports detail that its movements produce soft grinding sounds but do not cause it any structural failure. Oddly, the gunfire is very similar to that of a standard firearm, despite observations that the item only loads granite bullets and granite powder into the musket (which is also unharmed by the firing). In spite of its efforts, some fecal matter does manage to strike SCP-011, and it has reportedly become distressed when it has had a large amount of feces on it, on some rare occasions even firing at humans.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-011/SCP011.jpg,,,,,,,
12,Euclid,2," SCP-012 was retrieved by Archaeologist K.M. Sandoval during the excavation of a northern Italian tomb destroyed in a recent storm. The object, a piece of handwritten musical score entitled ""On Mount Golgotha"", part of a larger set of sheet music, appears to be incomplete. The red/black ink, first thought to be some form of berry or natural dye ink, was later found to be human blood from multiple subjects. The first personnel to locate the sheet (Site 19 Special Salvage) had two (2) members descend into insanity, attempting to use their own blood to finish the composition, ultimately resulting in massive blood loss and internal trauma.",,,,,,,,
13,Safe,1, SCP-013 is the collective designation of 242 cigarettes which display similar anomalies. The most common external detail between instances is the presence of the words “Blue Lady” hand-written on each cigarette in blue ink.,https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-013/SCP-013updated/medium.jpg,,,,,,,
14,Safe,1," SCP-014 is a Caucasian male, appearing to be approximately 30 years of age, with black hair, brown eyes, and a somewhat round face. Records indicate his name to be Robert Chetford, confined in 1915 to the Norwich Asylum in Connecticut for delusional insanity, claiming that he had been cursed to live forever, and was slowly turning into concrete in consequence. The asylum closed in 1937, and the patients were transferred to various other facilities. SCP-014 came to Foundation attention in 19¦¦, from rumours of a patient who seemed to be entirely immobile and showed no signs of aging. Further investigation determined that acquisition was warranted.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-014/3241597616_e47326fc1a-new.jpg,,,,,,,
15,Euclid,2," SCP-015 is a mass of pipes, vents, boilers and other various plumbing apparatus completely filling a warehouse in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦. The pipes appear to grow when not under observation, attempting to connect to nearby structures via sewer systems and underground plumbing. SCP-015 contains, at current estimate, over 190 kilometers (120 miles) of pipes, ranging in diameter from 2.5 cm to over 1 m. Some pipes appear new, while others are rusted and leaking. Pipes have been reported as being made of bone, wood, steel, pressed ash, human flesh, glass, and granite. No pipes composed of lead, PVC plastic, copper, or any other traditional material for the production of pipes have been found.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-015/SCP-015New/medium.jpg,,,,,,,
16,Keter,3," SCP-016 is a blood-borne pathogen recovered from a mine worker in ¦¦¦¦¦ who injured himself while working in a deep coal seam. Said wound became contaminated with coal dust from the mine, possibly infecting the worker with dormant spores. Over the next several days, SCP-016 proceeded to infect the remaining employees at the mining camp, as well as the CDC crisis team dispatched to deal with the epidemic. Foundation personnel then took over the investigation and terminated all affected personnel. Patient Zero was brought into captivity, and the mine shaft was collapsed by an explosive device.",,,,,,,,
17,Keter,3," SCP-017 is a humanoid figure approximately 80 centimeters in height, anatomically similar to a small child, but with no discernible identifying features. SCP-017 seems to be composed of a shadowy, smoke-like shroud. No attempt to find any object beneath the shroud has been successful, but the possibility has not been ruled out.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-017/scp017InCaptivity.jpg,,,,,,,
18,Euclid,2," SCP-018 has the appearance of a Super Ball made by the Wham-O company in 1969. It is six (6) centimeters in diameter and coloured red. Found when the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ company was hired to clean out a warehouse that had Wham-O merchandise in it, SCP-018 was noted to be able to bounce with extreme height. At first thought to be a pleasant child's toy, SCP-018 was able to bounce with over two hundred percent (200%) efficiency (that is, if dropped one (1) meter, it would bounce two (2), then four (4), then eight (8), then sixteen (16)). The ball soon became a dangerous projectile, reaching speeds estimated at over 100 km/h and damaging property and injuring five (5) in the city of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦. It came to a rest after several days in the nearby lake of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, and was retrieved by SCP personnel. Due to the speed of the object, and the total surprise by its victims, no cover-up story was required or initiated.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-018/superball.jpg,,,,,,,
19,Keter,3," SCP-019 appears to be a very large ceramic vase, 1.8 m in diameter at the mouth and 2.4 m high. Style and decoration indicate it was created in Classical Greece, although conclusive dating is impossible, as the surface is entirely unbreakable by any known means. If a successful method is discovered, SCP-019 is to be destroyed with prejudice.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-019/scp-019-new.jpg,,,,,,,
20,Keter,3," SCP-020 is a fast-spreading fungal organism that is capable of affecting the senses and behavior of living creatures, including humans. Samples of SCP-020 exhibit an unknown effect that renders them effectively invisible to direct observation, even when under a microscope. SCP-020 is only visible to humans when viewed through photographic or video surveillance.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-020/scp020.jpg,,,,,,,
21,Safe,1," SCP-021 takes the form of a large and elaborate tattoo of a serpentine dragon in the oriental style, covering approximately 0.8 square meters of skin. This tattoo is fully animate within the confines of its host's skin and behaves largely as a normal animal would, albeit in only two dimensions. The tattoo's movement causes constant pain to its host, comparable and similar in character to simultaneous tattooing and tattoo removal on a large scale. The organism tends to spend most of its time on and near the torso. SCP-021 displays no intelligence beyond a basic pattern of feeding and locomotion, although actually measuring the intelligence of a two-dimensional life-form has proven impossible thus far.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-021/021-new.jpg,,,,,,,
22,Euclid,2," SCP-022 is a morgue in the basement of [REDACTED] Hospital in Great Britain. Until 198¦, there were no reported anomalous occurrences within the morgue. Reports of strange activity were first received in November of 198¦. The area was soon quarantined by the Foundation, with an official story being released that the entire building had been condemned. The reason for the sudden manifestation of its strange properties remains under investigation.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-022/SCP-022.png,,,,,,,
23,Euclid,2," SCP-023 is a large, sexless shaggy canine (1.5 meters at the shoulder) with black fur.  It has bright orange-red  eyes  and prominent teeth  (see  Incident Report 023-26 ). Any time an individual makes eye contact with SCP-023, either that person or a member of their immediate family will die exactly one (1) year after eye contact is broken. Research into the method of selection is incomplete due to a moratorium on experiments, but the available data suggests that having a larger immediate family lessens the chance of the individual making eye contact themselves dying, and neither a pattern nor a preference in victim types have been found. This may indicate that SCP-023's victim is designated entirely at random, but it is unknown whether this selection occurs at the beginning or at the end of the one-year time period. Attempts to terminate an individual who has made eye contact with SCP-023 and their entire immediate family before the one-year time period has ended [DATA EXPUNGED].",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-023/scp-023.png,,,,,,,
24,Euclid,2," SCP-024 is an abandoned sound stage that was once owned by ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦. However, SCP-024 itself had been abandoned since 19¦¦, and it is unknown whether its special properties manifested before or after its abandonment. SCP-024 is located in the heart of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, and was initially discovered when a group of teenage youths broke into the abandoned compound. The testimony of the lone ""winner"" when she turned herself in to the police was enough to have Foundation assets mobilize to contain SCP-024.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-024/024.jpg,,,,,,,
25,Safe,1," SCP-025 is a wooden wardrobe measuring 0.97 m x 0.62 m x 1.95 m, full of clothing dating from a number of time periods. Articles contained within the chest, collectively named SCP-025-1, match with styles of decades from the 1920s to the present. The apparel from each time frame varies with regard to style; for example, a polyester striped shirt and pair of charcoal suit pants both correspond with general styles of the 1970s. The only unifying aspect of every article contained in SCP-025 is that each one is in poor condition; moths have eaten at much of the collection, and tears and runs are not uncommon.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-025/025.jpeg/medium.jpg,,,,,,,
26,Euclid,2, SCP-026 is a three (3) story public school building built in ¦¦¦¦. It has two (2) wings connected to a central foyer. It was declared condemned in ¦¦¦¦ after it was found the floor plan didn't match up to the building's blueprints (see  Interview Log 026-01 ). It came to the Foundation's attention after several disappearances in the area were linked to visits to the abandoned building.,https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-026/SCP-026-A-new.jpg,,,,,,,
27,Euclid,2," SCP-027 appears to be a phenomenon of unknown source that seems to be tied to one human subject (currently 027-02) at a time. As host to SCP-027, subject 027-02 is constantly surrounded by swarming vermin that are drawn to his location. The subject does not appear able to assert control over these creatures in any way, and is in fact prone to occasional attacks from feral specimens. These creatures have also been known to attack personnel who approach too closely.",,,,,,,,
28,Safe,1," SCP-028 is located in an abandoned storage yard outside a copper mine in northern Michigan. SCP-028 has no detectable physical presence of any kind, but its effect occurs in a 2.1 meter (7 foot) cube around what is commonly held as the “center” of SCP-028. All forms of scanning and testing in the area of SCP-028 have shown no abnormal readings. Adding or removing objects, or attempting to remove dirt from under SCP-028 has no effect in altering the size or shape of SCP-028’s area of effect, nor the onset or quality of the Effect.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-028/scp-028.png,,,,,,,
29,Keter,3," SCP-029 appears to be a pubescent female of Asiatic-Indian descent. She appears to suffer from alopecia universalis. Over 80% of her pigmentation is a true black, while the rest of her skin has a complete lack of melanin, to the point of albinism. Her eyes are also a dark black in color.",,,,,,,,
30,Safe,1," SCP-030 appears as a hairless, genderless, grey-toned human 71 centimeters (28 inches) in height and weighing 12.70 kilograms (two British stone in antiquated measure). Its solid blue eyes lack discernible irises or pupils, and resemble small cut sapphires. SCP-030 possesses an androgynous voice with a pronounced English accent not currently identifiable as specific to any modern region. It is able to converse, read and write in Ancient Greek, Latin, Italian, English, Spanish and Portuguese as well as two (2) additional languages that have not yet been identified despite SCP-030's insistence that they should be ""common knowledge."" SCP-030 has also demonstrated knowledge of physics, chemistry, astronomy, mathematics and horticulture roughly equivalent to that of a 17th-century CE academic. In addition, SCP-030 has demonstrated knowledge on these topics along research lines that do not appear in the historical record. These alternative or entirely unknown approaches to research in the natural sciences are one source of SCP-030's utility in consultation.",,,,,,,,
31,Euclid,2," SCP-031 is an amorphous organism with a mass of over 7,500 kg that has infiltrated the ductwork and maintenance infrastructure of the building. Tendrils emerging from SCP-031's central mass have spread through the hotel's plumbing and ductwork to all 105 floors of the building. At its peak, over 75% of the hotel's 3,000 rooms were contaminated by SCP-031. Reclamation efforts have destroyed ¦¦% of the initial infestation, but over ¦¦¦ rooms remain affected by SCP-031.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-031/scp-031rev.jpg,,,,,,,
32,Euclid,2," SCP-032 is a Type-F (imperfect external resemblance, internally inconsistent) human simulacrum of currently unknown origins. It is composed of an outer shell of pigmented silicone (5.5 mm thick), and various plastic fiber polymers, with the outward appearance of a Caucasian woman nearing the third decade of life. SCP-032's interior is composed entirely of liquid refined oil, lacking any skeletal or muscle structure. Despite this, SCP-032 is capable of locomotion and speech. SCP-032 is capable of maintaining the illusion of humanity at a moderate distance, but becomes unconvincing at a closer range, causing mild discomfort in most observers. This effect has been deemed non-anomalous. Despite apparently possessing fully-realized cognitive abilities, SCP-032 claims that it is not sapient, acting only as an intermediary instrument of its creators. The Foundation has not been able to verify or refute this claim as of yet.",,,,,,,,
33,Euclid,2," SCP-033 appears as a field of complex mathematical symbols ranging from simple layman-identifiable representations to those only interpretable by highly-trained mathematicians. The ""sum"" of the symbols is equal to a previously unknown integer (designated Theta Prime by Prof. Hutchinson) of intermediate value between ¦ and ¦.",,,,,,,,
34,Safe,1," SCP-034 is a primitive knife constructed out of pure obsidian. Tests reveal that SCP-034 is approximately 1000 years old. Despite its crude method of construction and age, SCP-034 is still incredibly sharp and requires no maintenance to retain its edge. Expert analysis hypothesizes that SCP-034 may be of South American origin, and that it may have been used in Native American rituals. Several accounts from Spanish conquistadors exploring the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ region support this hypothesis, with detailed writings on how ¦¦¦¦¦ priests would flay their victims alive with similar knives and wear their skin as a tribute to their gods.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-034/blade.jpg,,,,,,,
35,Keter,3," SCP-035 appears to be a white porcelain comedy mask, although, at times, it will change to tragedy. In these events, all existing visual records, such as photographs, video footage, even illustrations, of SCP-035 automatically change to reflect its new appearance.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-035/scp--035--002-new.gif,,,,,,,
36,Safe,1," SCP-036 includes the location, Site-22A (a small airport in the Mosul region of northern Iraq) and Site-22B (the destination of passengers boarding at Site-22A). The key components of SCP-036 are:",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-036/SCP-036-1.jpg,,,,,,,
37,Euclid,2," SCP-037 appears to be a star approximately 5 cm (2 in) in diameter, with a luminosity of about 1*10 -12  times that of our sun and a surface temperature of about 5000 K (determined by UBVRI analysis). The origin of SCP-037 is unknown, however, analysis suggests that it shares many properties in common with a typical main sequence star, other than its anomalously small size. It is theorized to have entered the Earth's magnetosphere via the North Magnetic Pole.",,,,,,,,
38,Safe,1," SCP-038 was found on an abandoned farm in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, New York, in 19¦¦. It was at first thought to be a common apple tree. However, upon closer inspection, it became apparent that SCP-038 was growing things other than apples and, in fact, other than fruit.",,,,,,,,
,,6, SCP-039 consists of twenty-three proboscis monkeys ( Nasalis larvatus ) which have been subject to radical anatomical changes. These alterations are summarized below:,https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-039/monkey-new.jpg,,,,,,,
40,Anomalous Human,5, SCP-040 is a human child capable of at-will manipulation of the physical characteristics of living organisms. Modified organisms are collectively referred to as SCP-040-1.,,,,,,,,
41,Safe,1," SCP-041 is a male human suffering from irreversible damage to his central nervous system, which is believed to have been caused by an infection of a rare strain of bacterial meningitis. Although antibiotics were successful in clearing the infection, the membranes surrounding his brain and spinal cord had reacted to the infection by severing many neurons connecting the central nervous system to the rest of the body. SCP-041 must rely on a respirator to sustain his breathing, a biventricular pacemaker to keep his heart beating, and a naso-gastric tube to provide nutrition.",,,,,,,,
42,Safe,1," SCP-042 is an animal believed to be a member of the genus  Equus . Its coat is white in color with some small brown spotting. It stands at 183 cm (18 hands) to its withers and weighs 710 kg. Its weight has dropped significantly since it has been in Foundation custody, due to both atrophy from lack of physical activity and refusal to eat. The liquid nutrient diet forcibly administered keeps it alive but it remains emaciated and weak. SCP-042 exhibits two large bone protrusions from its back, linked to powerful musculature (now atrophied) throughout its back. These bones end at 37 centimeters from the surface of its back, and they protrude from the skin at open, ragged wounds. To date, no healing has been observed of these wounds, though some clotting must be taking place for SCP-042 to have not bled out.",http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-042/SCP-042-new.jpg,,,,,,,
43,Safe,1," SCP-043 appears to be a vinyl copy of ""The White Album"" by the Beatles; however, upon closer inspection, the record has no grooves. In spite of this, the record will play from start to finish regardless of the starting position of the needle.",http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-043/whitealbum-new.jpg,,,,,,,
44,Safe,1," SCP-044 is a howitzer, secretly manufactured in the late stages of the Second World War by Krupp engineers, personally supervised by Albert Speer, German Minister of Armaments and War Production under Adolf Hitler. SCP-044 is unique not only because of its size (251,000 kg, or 251 metric tonnes), but also because it fires unconventional artillery using an atypical delivery method. Rather than having a breech for loading shells, the rear of the barrel is configured into a massive air-compression chamber. Any object or pile of objects that fits may be loaded into SCP-044’s muzzle to be used as ammunition. Because of its size, SCP-044 must remain rail-mounted and requires two freight locomotives to move.",http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-044/SCP-44.jpg,,,,,,,
45,Safe,1," SCP-045 is an icosahedron composed of ice XII 1  heavily occluded with planar fractures in a regular, complex pattern. SCP-045 has an average radius of 1.7 meters and density of 2.6 g/cm³, which is approximately twice that of non-anomalous ice XII.",,,,,,,,
46,Euclid,2," SCP-046 is a predatory botanical mass located in southwestern Kentucky. SCP-046 is composed of two parts. SCP-046-1 is a large mass of vegetative matter, composed largely of plants indigenous to the region, including  Quercus alba, Ilex aquifolium,  and  Lonicera sempervirens,  though several offshoots composed of other plant species are also present. SCP-046-2 is the land in the immediate vicinity of SCP-046-1, extending to a roughly circular area twenty meters in radius from its base. This area is SCP-046's primary feeding area. SCP-046 is capable of attracting prey within a 50km radius through hallucinogenic means; all evacuations of personnel should carry them outside of this radius to disable SCP-046's effect.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-046/46-1.jpg,,,,,,,
47,Keter,3," SCP-047 is a heavily rusted, breached gas cylinder made of an iron-[REDACTED] alloy. When exposed to open air, the material of the cylinder evaporates slowly, producing a previously undocumented mutagenic gas. This gas has no effect on eukaryotic organisms (e.g. humans), but profoundly alters prokaryotes, showing preference for common human microbiota - the natural microorganisms that live on the skin and throughout the body. On rare occasions these mutations produce a ""superbug"" (collectively known as SCP-047-1), a natural commensal with enhanced survivability and therefore opportunistic pathogenicity. The pattern of changes induced by SCP-047 suggests that these highly infectious microbes are, at least to some degree, selected for.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-047/047.png,,,,,,,
48,None (see description),5," SCP-048 has long been considered the ""cursed SCP number"" by SCP staff: any items given this designation tend to be destroyed, decommissioned, stolen, or otherwise lost to the Foundation, usually through no fault of any individual person. In addition, personnel assigned to SCP-048 in its various incarnations have had a 50% higher rate of turnover due to death, dismemberment, and disciplinary action.",,,,,,,,
49,Euclid,2," SCP-049 is a humanoid entity, roughly 1.9 meters in height, which bears the appearance of a medieval plague doctor. While SCP-049 appears to be wearing the thick robes and the ceramic mask indicative of that profession, the garments instead seem to have grown out of SCP-049's body over time 1 , and are now nearly indistinguishable from whatever form is beneath them. X-rays indicate that despite this, SCP-049 does have a humanoid skeletal structure beneath its outer layer.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-049/SCP-049-Image-2.png,,,,,,,

51,Safe,1," SCP-051 is a 25 cm (10 in) anatomically correct model of a human female, carved out of ivory, with typically Asian features. Microscopic analysis shows that the head hair is human hair. The doll is jointed at the shoulders, hips, and knees. The 'stomach' area of the doll is fully removable as a 'cap' of ivory, exposing a detailed ribcage and organs, and a 2.5 cm (1 in) ivory fetus connected to the main figure by a leather cord umbilicus.",,,,,,,,
52,Euclid,2," SCP-052 is a type R4 New York City subway train. Official records indicate this train was built in 1932 and decommissioned for scrap in 1975. Nevertheless, it continues to appear on the Uptown A/D track at the 59th St. and 8th Avenue station at 11:57 p.m. every Saturday. The train is in perfect condition and labeled as an “A” train. SCP-052 appears at the designated time, opens its doors to accept/discharge passengers for approximately five minutes, then closes its doors and disappears. It does not appear to ever contain passengers, except for those leaving the train during its appearance.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-052/scp-052.png,,,,,,,
53,Euclid,2," SCP-053 appears to be a small 3-year-old girl. She is capable of basic speech and appears to be slightly above average in mental development.

54,Safe,1," Out of the water, the subject most often appears as a female humanoid with a mean volume of 90 L comprised entirely of water (other forms are possible, commonly geometric shapes). When it enters a body of water, it becomes indistinguishable from its surroundings. The subject must periodically return to a body of water in order to maintain its volume due to evaporation. Initially found in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, it was moved to Site-08 for further study. Subject was initially curious about Foundation personnel and seemed to enjoy interacting with maintenance staff and researchers, and mimicking their forms. After a number of weeks, the creature apparently felt comfortable enough to remain out of the water during routine monitoring, though it retreated when attempts were made to study its composition.",,,,,,,,
55,Keter,3," SCP-055 is a ""self-keeping secret"" or ""anti-meme"". Information about SCP-055's physical appearance as well as its nature, behavior, and origins is self-classifying. To clarify:",,,,,,,,
56,Euclid,2," SCP-056 is a being of variable size, gender, and appearance, which changes in response to the environment around it, especially in regards to living and sentient beings. Its most common form is of a handsome man in his middle twenties, dressed in a garb of similar appearance to that of the personnel guarding it but of a higher quality and aesthetic value. However, it has been recorded as taking these forms:",,,,,,,,
57,Safe,1," SCP-057 is a subterranean chamber with an approximate cylindrical height of three (3) meters and diameter of eighteen (18) meters. Artifact is comprised of impenetrable slate-coloured stone. Inside the chamber are dozens of parallelepiped monoliths extending from floor to ceiling that slide in various directions while SCP-057 is active. It was discovered several meters below ¦¦¦¦¦ on ¦¦/¦¦/¦¦¦¦ during the construction of a secure containment enclosure for SCP-¦¦¦. Consequently, SCP-¦¦¦ was assigned an alternate location at Site-¦¦.",,,,,,,,
58,Keter,3," SCP-058 resembles a bovine heart, with four (4) arthropod-like legs used primarily for movement, and four (4) tentacles of adjustable length, covered with razor sharp spines. It has a single sharp 'stinger' on its rear, where the hole for the superior vena cava would be in a typical organ. SCP-058's tentacles can be ""whipped"" to a distance of 3.2 m (10.5 ft) at speeds in excess of 320 km/h (200 mph). SCP-058 is extremely hostile and will use every opportunity afforded to it to inflict damage on its surroundings. SCP-058 has been shown to be highly resilient to trauma, and should be approached with caution even when apparently incapacitated.",,,,,,,,
59,Keter,3," SCP-059 is a radioactive mineral of unknown origin, superficially resembling scheelite. A component of SCP-059 is believed to originate in an alternate universe, and to be responsible for its anomalous properties. In addition to alpha, beta, and gamma radiation, SCP-059 specimens produce a previously unknown type of radiation, apparently unique to the object, tentatively designated 'delta radiation'. Delta radiation is accompanied by Cherenkov radiation, visible as a blue glow.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-059/bluerock1.png,,,,,,,
60,Keter,3, SCP-060 is a grove of seventeen white oak trees ( Quercus alba ). The grove is spread across approximately 8 acres in rural northeastern Minnesota. A house on the property was demolished during the construction of Satellite-Site 66-060 after being combed by Foundation personnel for information regarding SCP-060. See addendum.,https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-060/not-firewood-small.jpg,,,,,,,
61,Safe,1," SCP-061 is an acoustic computer program being developed by SCP researchers with the intent of producing successful countermeasures to similar programs being developed by  governments  and  individuals  around the world. Inspired by research on [DATA EXPUNGED], SCP Command saw both the potential and harm in the ability to control the brain functions of other human beings. Laymen understand that music can elicit certain emotions and memories or various sounds can elicit fear and excitement by simply being heard. Governments around the world have been attempting to expand on that premise for decades; SCP Research is the first to elicit responses on higher mental activities.",,,,,,,,
62,Euclid,2," SCP-062 appears to be an unbranded personal desktop computer housed in an aluminum case of indeterminate manufacture. SCP-062 is unusually heavy at approximately 24kg, and lacks manufacturing or branding labels of any kind. The words ""infomation is freedom [sic]"" were found scratched into the casing near the back, apparently with a key or similar object.",,,,,,,,
63,Safe,1," SCP-063 appears to be an average, pale blue toothbrush. Stenciled along the side of the object are the words “The World's Best TothBrush [sic]”. The word ""toothbrush"" is spelled incorrectly, though whether this was accidental or a purposeful action by the creators of the object is unknown. SCP-063 displays the ability to effortlessly cleave through any and all dead or inorganic matter, the focal point of this ability being the bristles. However, matter touched by the bristles is not separated, such as by way of a knife, but completely expunged from existence, leaving no trace whatsoever. This mode of operation is reminiscent of  SCP-2207 , suggesting the two anomalies share a connection or were created by the same entity or entities. Additionally, subjects who have used SCP-063 have claimed that the experience left their teeth feeling remarkably clean. In spite of its extraordinary abilities, lab analysis has discerned that SCP-063 is completely made of common plastic.",,,,,,,,
64,Safe,1," SCP-064 is a light brown earthenware brick composed primarily of silicon oxides and some organic matter. The object weighs 1.6 kg and measures some 10 cm x 6 cm x 20 cm. Its surface is smooth and flat, with some minor cosmetic chips. By and large, the object is visually similar to most solid bricks used in construction.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-064/SCP-064.png,,,,,,,
65,Euclid,2," SCP-065 is a spherical region of space approximately 12 m in radius located on a farm near [REDACTED]. SCP-065 was formed by the destruction of an anomalous artifact on-site by the Global Occult Coalition on ¦¦/¦/¦¦; immediately following this initial event, the radius of SCP-065 was estimated to have initially expanded to 108 m in radius, resulting in the deaths of eleven (11) GOC operatives and five (5) civilians. Since containment by the Foundation, the effective radius of SCP-065 has shrunk to and remained stable at its current size.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-065/065.png,,,,,,,
66,,3," SCP-066 is an amorphous mass of braided yarn and ribbon weighing approximately one kilogram. Strands of SCP-066 may be taken individually and manipulated; when this is done, a note on the diatonic scale (C-D-E-F-G-A-B) is produced by the object.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-066/yarn1.jpg,,,,,,,
67,Safe,1," SCP-067 is a fountain pen made by a German supply company called Pelikan at some point between World War I and II. It is pale green in color, with a single red line going straight down along the side. The shell is oak and the nib is extremely sharp, capable of piercing human skin if pressed even lightly. Though it apparently lacks a reservoir, the nib never appears to run out of fresh ink. In addition, the pen writes in Iron Gall ink, which is suitable for artists but would normally corrode typical fountain pens quickly.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-067/067-1.jpg,,,,,,,
68,Safe,1," SCP-068 is a wire stick figure, 9.8 cm tall, made of an unknown metal. The figure is composed of a single wire looping back to the center. The wire itself appears to have been bent numerous times in multiple places.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-068/SCP068.jpg,,,,,,,
69,Safe,1," SCP-069 is a presumed humanoid entity of variable appearance and gender. Through an unknown ability, whenever SCP-069 is left alone with a recently deceased human body, the body will disappear and SCP-069 will take on the appearance, mannerisms, and knowledge of the recently dead individual.",,,,,,,,
70,Safe,1," SCP-070 appears to be a human male of Native American descent, with a normal appearance save for a pair of rusty metal “wings” emerging from his back. Each wing is composed of several flat iron bars about 6 cm wide connected end-to-end by rotating rivets to form an articulated length of metal over two meters long. Hanging from these bars are chains of various lengths, twenty-two on each wing, each tipped with a barbed arrowhead. SCP-070 appears to have no other anomalous properties besides these wings.",,,,,,,,
71,Euclid,2," SCP-071 is a metamorphic entity that possesses the ability to assume forms consistent with that of its observer's strongest sexual desire. This ability is effective even through barriers designed to prevent SCP-071's recognition of any observers such as through closed circuit surveillance or one-way mirrors, but can be prevented by introducing a delay in surveillance footage so that such observation does not occur in real-time. SCP-071 appears to be unable or unwilling to change form without external stimuli, instead remaining in its last form when left unobserved. There appears to be little or no limit to the forms SCP-071 is capable of assuming (see Addendum 071-01 for additional information).",,,,,,,,
72,Safe,1," Instances of SCP-072 were first discovered in an apartment building in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, Michigan, after two local media reports on SCP-072’s effects caused a local panic which drew the attention of embedded Foundation Agent ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-072/072.jpg,,,,,,,
73,Euclid,2," SCP-073 appears to be a heavily-tanned male of Arabic or Middle Eastern descent in his early thirties, 185 cm (6'1"") tall and 75 kg (165 lbs), with black hair and blue eyes. Arms, legs, spinal cord, and shoulder blades of the subject appear to have been replaced with artificial versions of unknown make and metal. Subject only takes notice of this when it is pointed out, and states that it has no knowledge of how, why, or when these replacements took place, stating it had had them as long as it could remember. There is a symbol engraved into the forehead of the subject, which appears to be of Sumerian origin. Symbol has of yet been untranslated, and subject appears distressed when the symbol is mentioned at all, refusing to speak on it. Subject does need to eat and drink on a regular basis, but is strictly carnivorous owing to its effect on plant-based items.",,,,,,,,
74,Euclid,2," SCP-074 is an anomalous organism which uses various quantum properties at a macroscopic scale, and in other ways modifies the standard laws of physics within its immediate vicinity. The specific nature of these modifications appears to be linked to the extent to which humans in SCP-074's vicinity are aware of the precise details of the physical laws which SCP-074 modifies, such that research to determine whether SCP-074 has a given property or capability, results in SCP-074 developing or manifesting that property or capability. Archive 074-317E — a full list of the anomalous physical phenomena known to be, or to have been, associated with SCP-074 — is available to personnel level 3 or higher; personnel who access this document will be disqualified from working with SCP-074, or for any other reason coming within 5 km of Site 81.",,,,,,,,

76,Keter,3, SCP-076 consists of two components: a stone cube (SCP-076-1) and a humanoid entity contained within (SCP-076-2).,,,,,,,,
77,Euclid,2," SCP-077 appears to be the top half of a human skull engraved with runes, each filled with an unidentified black resin. The runes change every lunar month (defined by the full moon rising above the horizon in Ireland), as well as at the winter and summer solstices, the spring and autumn equinoxes, and whenever a partial, annular, or total solar or lunar eclipse is visible from Ireland.",,,,,,,,
78,Euclid,2," SCP-078 is a pink neon sign approximately one and a half meters long that displays the phrase ""TOO LATE TO DIE YOUNG."" It was initially recovered in the town of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, after standard Foundation data mining protocols recorded an abnormally high death rate due to starvation or other forms of self-neglect.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-078/078.png,,,,,,,
79,Euclid,2," SCP-079 is an Exidy Sorcerer microcomputer built in 1978. In 1981, its owner, ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦ (deceased), a college sophomore attending ¦¦¦, took it upon himself to attempt to code an AI. According to his notes, his plan was for the code to continuously evolve and improve itself as time went on. His project was completed a few months later, and after some tests and tweaks, ¦¦¦¦¦ lost interest and moved on to a different brand of microcomputer. He left SCP-079 in his cluttered garage, still plugged in, and forgot about it for the next five years.",,,,,,,,
80,Euclid,2," It is unknown if SCP-080 has a physical mass or ""body"", as all attempts to interact with it physically have failed and have been met with adverse effects (see  Experiment Log 080-2 ). Researchers and personnel have described seeing SCP-080 as various shadows and humanoid effigies, with the only common attribute being two smoking ""eyes"". It has come to the attention of researchers that SCP-080 induces uncontrollable drowsiness upon anyone entering its chamber. After approximately 30 minutes, any person observing it will be forced into REM sleep and may suffer irreversible psychological damage. This effect occurs even if SCP-080 is being observed from a separate room (see Incident-080-1). If at any time SCP-080 finds a way to ""hide"" itself (such as in a cupboard, under a bed, covered in a sheet, etc.), it will disappear entirely. Additionally, if any light enters SCP-080’s containment room with a greater luminance than that produced by a standard children’s night light, SCP-080 will instantly vanish. Both of these events are considered a containment breach and any personnel responsible for this will be severely reprimanded and possibly reassigned. For all inquiries regarding the origin of SCP-080 and its procurement by the Foundation, please see attached [REDACTED].",,,,,,,,
81,Euclid,2," SCP-081 is a contagious virus that appears to be a mutated version of the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ virus, but with ¦ segments in its RNA instead of ¦. The virus is human specific, but is spread by rats who act as passive carriers. SCP-081 can also be spread through sexual intercourse and exposure to infected blood.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-081/scp081.png,,,,,,,
82,Euclid,2," SCP-082 is genetically human; however, through some process (either chemical, hormonal, cancerous, or supernatural), SCP-082 has grown to giant proportions. Approximately 2.4 meters tall (around 8 ft) and weighing over 310 kg (about 700 lb), SCP-082's physical characteristics are grossly disproportional. It has a slightly pointed balding head, a large rounded chin and jaw, a bulbous nose, and dark sunken eyes. Subject is both overweight and possesses a great amount of muscle mass. Forearms are muscular and dangerous, with a circumference of about 71 cm (about 28 in). The breadth of the subject's fist is nearly 30 cm along the knuckles (almost 12 in). Though feet are large, they are small in proportion to subject's body (men's size 14 US). Subject's skin is tanned dark and overall physical appearance is compounded by numerous scars (the results of years of attempts at suppression and containment). Most X-rays have been difficult to interpret because of the high density of its muscle tissue, but scans have revealed countless bullets and even several knife and sword blades lodged in SCP-082's flesh.",,,,,,,,
83,Euclid,2," SCP-083 appears to be an uninhabited, two-story row house in a general state of disrepair, with an interior of approximately 366 square meters. It is located in the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ block of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦. The deed and property tax records for the address are missing after ¦¦¦¦¦¦. The last known persons to reside at the address were the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ family, but [DATA EXPUNGED]. Until acquisition by the Foundation, the property was the reputed ""office"" for local narcotics dealers who gained entry to the structure through a front window, since the locking mechanisms on both the front and back doors were corroded and frozen shut. SCP-083 first came to the Foundation's attention on ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, when an altercation outside the building resulted in the front door being kicked in by [DATA EXPUNGED].",,,,,,,,
84,Euclid,2," SCP-084 appears to be a large radio tower positioned in the center of a large, open field with two small outbuildings. Direct observation and sample collection from SCP-084 is impossible, due to the effect that is emitted around/from SCP-084. SCP-084 appears to emit a form of wave or radiation that has a detrimental effect on local space-time/reality. The most pronounced aspect of this is the alteration of local space within the active area of SCP-084. Externally, the active area forms a rough “dome” shape of two hundred (200) meters in diameter. SCP-084 appears inside this area at random points,  appearing to “jump” at random times , sometimes even appearing in multiple locations at once inside the active area. Internally, the space appears to be unlimited, with SCP-084 at the “center”.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-084/radio%20tower.jpg,,,,,,,
85,Safe,1," SCP-085 is the result of an experiment conducted between  SCP-067  and  SCP-914 . Using  SCP-067 , Test Subject-1101F drew a single female figure, about 15 cm (6 in) in height and 3.8 cm (1.5 in) wide, in summer dress with long hair pulled back into a ponytail, with the name ""Cassandra"" written underneath. Dr. [EXPUNGED] proposed using SCP-914 on various settings on images created by  SCP-067 : Using the [Fine] setting, the 'Cassandra' sketch was transmuted into her present form: a sentient black-and white-animated young woman drawn in clean strokes. Further attempts to duplicate this result have been unsuccessful.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-085/scp085-03.png,,,,,,,
86,,6," SCP-086 is a collective sessile organism whose component parts resemble items of office equipment from 1978, and which contains a consciousness claiming to be that of former Foundation administrator Dr. [REDACTED] (1907-1978). Its 8 (eight) components are: a rotary telephone (SCP-086-1), a wall-mounted pencil sharpener (SCP-086-2), a desk stapler (SCP-086-3), a microfiche reader (SCP-086-4), a water cooler (SCP-086-5), a filing cabinet (SCP-086-6), a scientific calculator (SCP-086-7), and a slide rule (SCP-086-8). No physical connection or electromagnetic transmission between any of these components has been detected.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-086/rotary.JPG,,,,,,,
87,Euclid,2," SCP-087 is an unlit platform staircase. Stairs descend on a 38 degree angle for 13 steps before reaching a semicircular platform of approximately 3 meters in diameter. Descent direction rotates 180 degrees at each platform. The design of SCP-087 limits subjects to a visual range of approximately 1.5 flights. A light source is required for any subjects exploring SCP-087, as there are no lighting fixtures or windows present. Lighting sources brighter than 75 watts have shown to be ineffective, as SCP-087 seems to absorb excess light.",,,,,,,,
88,Safe,1," SCP-088 is a humanoid with reptilian features which appears to have been mummified in a languid posture. However, SCP-088 is merely in a state of hibernation from which it may recover if it is again exposed to a more hospitable environment than its current containment. Research has indicated that SCP-088 is approximately 6000 years old and is capable of secreting a variety of hazardous biological compounds from its mouth and hands. Some of these substances could be of great strategic value if replicated, but until a means to extract them without awakening SCP-088 is found, research into this area is on hold.",,,,,,,,
89,Euclid (see below),6," SCP-089 is a glazed earthenware statue, approximately 3 meters in height, depicting a winged, bull-headed humanoid with an open mouth. The front of the statue’s torso is hinged and can be opened from the top to reveal a cavity, approximately 0.6 cubic meters in volume, and can be locked from the outside. The rear of the statue bears an inscription in a Canaanite language (possibly Punic). 1  The statue dates from approximately the 2nd century BCE.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-089/scp-089-new.jpg,,,,,,,
90,Keter,3," SCP-090 was located and retrieved in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦¦¦¦¦ on April 10, 19¦¦. Prior to retrieval, SCP-090 had been located in a chamber at the nearby cathedral. SCP-090 was removed, the cathedral burned, 6 monks and the priest were terminated. SCP-090 has been located at Site ¦¦ since the retrieval. Object's initial location prior to the cathedral is unrecorded.",,,,,,,,
91,,NA," SCP-091 is a “Scotties” brand tissue box, currently empty. Immediately upon observing SCP-091, viewers report an overwhelming sense of nostalgia. Those affected begin reminiscing about times they “were near” SCP-091, major events that occurred while it was present, or people and places that somehow relate to it.",,,,,,,,
92,Safe,1," SCP-092 is a set of 3125 audio CDs, each labeled ""The Absolute Absolute Absolute Absolute BEST of The 5th Dimension!!!!!"", and marked with the names of the 31 performers who have at various times been part of the American singing group ""The 5th Dimension"". Each instance of SCP-092, when played in a standard CD player, will produce a distinct anomalous effect upon all individuals within hearing range. The anomalous phenomenon will last 74 minutes (the duration of a standard audio CD), during which time listeners will be unable to leave hearing range, or to shut off the CD player or otherwise interrupt its function. As well, when the anomalous phenomenon finishes, all surviving listeners will engage in synchronized vocalization of the phrase ""Wow, that was real cool""; synchronized vocalization has been observed in non-anglophones, pre-verbal infants, unconscious individuals, paralyzed individuals, and individuals physically incapable of speech due to laryngeal, lingual, and/or buccal damage.",,,,,,,,
93,Euclid,2," SCP-093 is a primarily red disc carved from a stone composite resembling cinnabar, with circular engravings and unknown symbols carved at 0.5 cm depth around the entire object. Deeper cuts are present on SCP-093 with a depth of 1 to 1.5 cm. SCP-093 is 7.62 cm in diameter and fits comfortably into most palms without abrasion. SCP-093 will change hue when held by a living individual. The colors taken by SCP-093 are still being researched to establish a link. Current belief holds that the changes depend upon regrets carried by the holder.",,,,,,,,
94,Keter,3," SCP-094 appears to be a perfectly black sphere, 163 cm in diameter, suspended approximately 3 m off the ground with no apparent means of support. SCP-094 has been classified as a miniature event horizon: any matter that moves into SCP-094, including light, is irretrievably gone. However, SCP-094 is not a black hole since it does not exert a gravitational pull.",,,,,,,,
95,Safe,1," SCP-095 appears to be a set of three moderately aged black and white comic books printed in 1932. The front and rear covers are missing and several pages have been rendered illegible due to water damage. It was found by Agent ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ in a small antique shop in Denver, Colorado, and purchased for a small fee without incident. The owner of the shop had apparently not read the item past the publisher’s date on the first page.",,,,,,,,
96,Euclid,2," SCP-096 is a humanoid creature measuring approximately 2.38 meters in height. Subject shows very little muscle mass, with preliminary analysis of body mass suggesting mild malnutrition. Arms are grossly out of proportion with the rest of the subject's body, with an approximate length of 1.5 meters each. Skin is mostly devoid of pigmentation, with no sign of any body hair.",,,,,,,,
97,Euclid,2," SCP-097 is a ten acre area of land in the state of [REDACTED], in the Midwestern United States. It is the abandoned remains of the [REDACTED] County Fair 1969, an area of approximately 2.3 km 2  (approx. 5.4 sq. mi). Structures within the SCP area exist in a state of moderate disrepair, consistent with the expected age and environment.",,,,,,,,
98,Safe,1," SCP-098 is a species of previously unknown crustacean.

103,Neutralized,0," SCP-103 was a Caucasian, humanoid cis male in his mid-forties. Family and friends of the anomaly were given a cover story of its death. Until cessation of anomalous effects, SCP-103 did not experience hunger, however the entity still required nutrients. In testing, the entity's gastrointestinal system had the imprint of a Cestoid, which had been hypothesized to be the cause of SCP-103's prior anomalous behavior.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-103/{$name}/medium.jpg,,,,,,,
104,Euclid,2," SCP-104 is a sphere, 35.5 cm (14 in) around and weighing 2.3 kg (5 lbs). The outside is glass and very smooth, coating the sphere in a layer 6 mm (0.2 in) thick. Under this layer is an extremely intricate design of very thin black and white lines. This inner “core” is a delicately carved ball of wood, giving slight texture to the line design. The design itself is unimaginably complex and seems to form something of a Rorschach test, as all viewers seem to have a different interpretation. Movement or a ticking sound from inside the sphere has been reported, but at this time is unconfirmed.",,,,,,,,
105,Safe,1," SCP-105 (formerly known as Iris Thompson) is a female human of European descent. Records indicate that SCP-105 was born in ¦¦¦¦, making her ¦¦ years old at the time of acquisition. She has blonde hair and blue eyes, and at the time of this article, is 1.54 meters in height and 50kg in weight.

106,Keter,3," SCP-106 appears to be an elderly humanoid, with a general appearance of advanced decomposition. This appearance may vary, but the “rotting” quality is observed in all forms. SCP-106 is not exceptionally agile, and will remain motionless for days at a time, waiting for prey. SCP-106 is also capable of scaling any vertical surface and can remain suspended upside down indefinitely. When attacking, SCP-106 will attempt to incapacitate prey by damaging major organs, muscle groups, or tendons, then pull disabled prey into its pocket dimension. SCP-106 appears to prefer human prey items in the 10-25 years of age bracket.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-106/106emergenceklay.jpg,,,,,,,
107,Safe,1," SCP-107 resembles the top section of a hollow turtle shell. The shell is composed of a hardened biological material of unknown origin. Despite its appearance, whether this material is derived from the shell of a standard sea turtle (superfamily  Chelonioidea ) is, as yet, unknown. The item is completely inert until the inside of the turtle shell comes into contact with a liquid; when it does so, said liquid appears to be absorbed very quickly. Where the liquid drains to is unknown, given the lack of visible pores on the inside of the shell. Once active, the red edge of the shell glows dimly, and the substance placed into the shell begins to precipitate in the atmosphere and fall as 'rain' in the area at least 0.5 m, but less than 10 km, from the object. This phenomenon is mobile: moving SCP-107 will move the area of effect, along with the 'exclusion zone'.",,,,,,,,
108,Safe,1," SCP-108 is accessible through the nostrils of Subject-108-1. Subject is an African-American female, 51 years old (see Addendum 108-1), who was previously employed as a cashier at ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, a small town hardware store in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, Kentucky. Since ¦-¦¦-¦¦¦¦, SCP-108 has been housed at Site-17.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-108/SCP108interior.jpg,,,,,,,
109,Euclid (See Addendum 109-1),6," SCP-109 is a standard-issue United States Army canteen (circa 1899) made of a tin alloy and fitted with a heavy cotton cover and a black leather strap. When opened, the item is seen to be nearly full of water. A seemingly unlimited amount of water can be removed from the container without changing the water level or the item's mass, which remains a constant 3.16 kg. Probes of the interior of the container reported an estimated volume of 2.8 L and a shape consistent with the outside.",,,,,,,,
110,Euclid,2," SCP-110 is an entire city that was found buried 0.5 kilometers underneath a large farm in [DATA EXPUNGED], New York. Survey Teams 2 and 3 concluded that the amount of surface area that the city is buried under covers approximately six (6) square kilometers. Numerous items of high interest have been discovered within SCP-110, and will henceforth be labeled as SCP-110-xx.",,,,,,,,
111,Safe,1," SCP-111 is an apparently artificial species of invertebrate vaguely resembling snails. Adult specimens of SCP-111 are approximately twenty (20) centimeters in length, twelve (12) centimeters in width, and fifteen (15) centimeters in height, although exact size differs slightly between specimens. SCP-111 specimens differ from ordinary snails in that they have a warm-blooded metabolism, complex eyes, small ""horns"" consisting of cartilage-ridged tentacles, apparently increased intelligence (personnel are requested to read Test Log ¦¦¦¦¦¦ for examples), and a complex vertebrate-type jaw structure; as well, specimens lay eggs possessing hardened shells.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-111/GardenpestSCP-new-new.png,,,,,,,
112,Euclid,2," SCP-112 is a steel sit-down rollercoaster, formerly known as the ""Blue Steelsurfer"". Built in 19¦¦, SCP-112 was marketed as the crown jewel of the ""¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦"" amusement park. Initial testing of the ride resulted in extremely negative experiences from testing staff. When these reports became public knowledge, the financial repercussions of the ""failure"" of the Steelsurfer resulted in the parent company of the amusement park going bankrupt. The property was abandoned and undisturbed until 19¦¦, when a local gang broke into the park and reactivated the improperly-disabled rides, SCP-112 included. When police attempted to arrest the members who were exiting SCP-112 after its 'inaugural' ride, the riders began to [REDACTED], attracting local media attention. (For more information, see Archive.112.¦¦¦¦). Suspecting the ride had traits within its mandate, the Foundation purchased the park (under the auspices of rebuilding the park as  Amusatastic Land ) in order to test any potential anomalous properties from the ride.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-112/coasters-new.jpg,,,,,,,
113,Safe,1," SCP-113 resembles a small, polished piece of red jasper. Analysis shows that SCP-113 is not composed of jasper, but [REDACTED] composition similar to that of other recovered objects.",,,,,,,,
114,Euclid,2," SCP-114 is a Pashtun woman of Afghani origin, approximately 40 years old and 160 cm tall. SCP-114 has the involuntary effect of fostering and escalating violent conflict between all individuals in her proximity. Subjects within ten to fifteen meters of SCP-114 become inconsolably aggressive at trivialities or points of little consequence, often to the degree of projecting hostile motives on others. Arguments generally arise between individuals after one to three minutes of exposure to SCP-114. The resulting arguments turn to violence in all cases.",,,,,,,,
115,Safe,1," SCP-115-1 is a toy dump truck, with no identifying markers or labels to identify its original manufacturer. However, unlike regular toy dump trucks, SCP-115-1 weighs as much as the actual vehicle it represents, roughly 90 tons. It is currently unknown how the vehicle weighs this much, as analysis of SCP-115-1's composition reveals that it is made of the same commercial plastic commonly found in similar cheap-quality toys.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-115/tonka.jpg,,,,,,,
116,Euclid,2," SCP-116 has the outward appearance of a Caucasian male of around 9 years of age. Skin is cauterized and scarred over 98% of body, limbs, and head. SCP-116’s bone structure is drastically different from standard  Homo sapiens  bone layout, and all bones are dangerously brittle. The most distinguishing difference between the human body and that of SCP-116 is the non-existence of joints in the latter. SCP-116 is entirely capable of independent movement, but to do so would cause multiple shattering breaks to all bones affected by said movement. To combat this, SCP-116 shows remarkable self-healing, and over a period of minutes can completely regenerate its rigid bone placement. SCP-116 has shown some language skill since acquisition; however, the only language it speaks is a disrupted and broken version of English in which every word has been replaced with an almost entirely unconnected one. Prolonged attempts to make sense of SCP-116’s speech have resulted in some long-term mental degradation in researchers. There seems to be no pattern to the word replacement, and attempts continue to translate it. Research suggests that SCP-116 may be capable of low level telepathy,  which deteriorates the victim’s brain functions  over a long period of time.",,,,,,,,
117,Safe,1," The item appears to be a regular multitool, of unknown make and brand, found in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, Florida. At first glance, only the normal tools are found (screwdriver, knife, can opener, etc.), but if the user is faced with a task, regardless of what tool the subject intends to pull out and use, a tool perfectly fitted for the job will take its place, regardless of spatial quantities that are being broken by the tool. All other tools always seem to be present, though, after the task is completed and the tool closed, unless faced with a task requiring that tool again, the tool cannot be found on the tool again.",,,,,,,,
118,Euclid,2," SCP-118 is a species of ocean-dwelling protista that is capable of assembling functional, self initiating, nuclear devices from materials present in ocean water. While SCP-118 is unknown and hence has not been classified by the scientific community, specimens resemble protists of the phylum Euglenophyta but have significantly increased levels of movement speed, nutrient storage capability and resistance to alpha radiation. Specimens of SCP-118 have been found in all of the world's oceans and seas.",https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-118/SCP118Pic.jpg,,,,,,,
119,Euclid,2," SCP-119 is a Panasonic [REDACTED] Microwave Oven. It was initially discovered by an agent, who had bought it from a liquidation sale of the assets from ¦¦¦¦ Valley Vineyards. It is believed that ¦¦¦¦ Valley Vineyards was using the anomalous properties of SCP-119 to rapidly age its products and create expensive vintages. Records show ¦¦¦¦ Valley Vineyards making under-the-table sales of vintages dated as far back as 19¦¦, many years before the company's inception in 2005. These sales are what led to the lawsuits accusing the company of falsifying product information and other forms of fraud, which eventually caused ¦¦¦¦ Valley Vineyards to declare bankruptcy. SCP-119 appears to be a standard model of microwave in all respects except that the magnetron unit does not produce microwave radiation. Instead, the magnetron emits a previously unknown type of radiation that accelerates time.",,,,,,,,
120,Safe,1," SCP-120 appears to be a small child’s paddling pool, pastel pink in colouration, with an inner diameter of approximately 2.5 metres and inner height of 0.3 metres. The pool appears to have been fabricated from common Earth plastics but has shown itself to be indestructible by any attempted means (see research report #120-32 for a full summary). The pool’s structure and response to pressure are typical for such a pool (it will flex when pressure is applied and is soft to the touch) but has amazing tensile strength and cannot be permanently stretched or ripped.",,,,,,,,
121,Euclid,2," SCP-121 is the region of land occupied by the former town of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, Colorado. The town was home to roughly 6,800 prior to enactment of current containment protocol, and holds roughly 3,000 buildings, both residential and commercial. Clouds above SCP-121 appear incapable of entering an area roughly twelve (12) kilometers in diameter, instead passing around the area; it is speculated this is related to SCP-121's range of effect, but it is not known how at this time. Buildings in SCP-121 will sporadically 1  detach from any foundations and ascend into the air. At this point, these buildings are identified as SCP-121-1.",,,,,,,,
122,Thaumiel,4," SCP-122 is a plastic night light in the shape of a star, thought to have been manufactured between 1960 and 1980.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-122/Night_light.jpg,,,,,,,
123,Euclid,2," Object is a gray geodesic sphere 65 cm in diameter consisting of sixty triangles. The areas between these triangles are empty, allowing the center of the sphere to be seen. The material the sphere is composed of is unknown, and upon the recommendation of Dr. ¦¦¦¦¦, research into the material composition shall be limited to visual observation until further notice. SCP-123 appears to weigh about 3.62 kg, though its actual mass is believed to be much higher.",,,,,,,,
124,Euclid,2, SCP-124 is a plot of soil approximately 9 m 2  in area and 14 m 3  in size. It was recovered from a Detroit basement when authorities were notified of two teenagers growing large amounts of marijuana.,,,,,,,,
125,Euclid,2," SCP-125 is an apparently sentient ""being"" that can only exist within reflections.",,,,,,,,
126,Euclid,2," SCP-126 is an invisible and intangible entity that can only be identified via sound. SCP-126 is sentient, with the ability to speak in multiple languages in a female voice and engage in conversation with any subject within range. To date, no method by which SCP-126 can be visually detected has been devised as SCP-126 does not appear to emit any kind of light, radiation, heat or electromagnetic energy. SCP-126 does appear to occupy an area, as evidenced by the ability to triangulate its suggested location via its voice. SCP-126 also emits sound when moving consistent with footsteps made by a human subject wearing high heels with a mass of approximately 55 to 60 kg, though no depressions can be seen in any floor materials and pressure sensors do not register any kind of presence. SCP-126 cannot pass through barriers that would prevent a normal human subject from passing (such as a closed door), but solid objects can be pushed through the space it occupies without any effect. For unknown reasons, SCP-126 will comply with any request for it to follow a specific human subject or move to a specific location without question, though it may move away afterwards or if it is not able to ""physically"" comply with the request.",,,,,,,,
127,Safe,1," SCP-127, upon first glance, appears to be a standard MP5K-PDW submachine gun. Tests have revealed that aside from the outer steel and polymer shell, the entirety of the firearm is organic and alive. The weapon's ammunition initially appeared to be human-like teeth. However, DNA testing of the ""bullets"" resulted in no match to any known species on Earth.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-127/scp-127_1.png,,,,,,,
128,Euclid,2," SCP-128 is an immaterial source of kinetic energy which can be conferred upon any nonliving solid material within line of sight of the source. The source itself is motile, with a tendency to remain along the walls or at the central wheel of the containment chamber. The line of sight is blocked by any opaque material, including lead, steel, or even single sheets of paper, but not transparent materials such as ballistic glass. Opaque radiolucent materials will contain SCP-128's range of effect, suggesting that transmission of energy occurs at visible light wavelengths, but darkness does not prevent transmission of kinetic energy.",,,,,,,,
129,Keter,3," SCP-129 is a series of at least ¦¦ different species of fungus that can infect any animal with mucosal membranes. Infection by SCP-129 can pass through up to five stages (depending on exposure to further member species of SCP-129, individual resistance, and other factors), with each stage of infection facilitating progression to the next stage by weakening the individual’s resistance to subsequent infection.",,,,,,,,
130,Euclid,2," SCP-130 is a post office in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, South Africa, constructed in 18¦¦. SCP-130 had been closed in 19¦¦ and left abandoned for ¦¦ years. The building is in excellent condition for its age, and maintains itself without human intervention, including moderate structural repairs. SCP-130 has been designated a Historic Site through an agreement with the South African government.",,,,,,,,
131,Safe,1," SCP-131-A and SCP-131-B (affectionately nicknamed the ""Eye Pods"" by personnel) are a pair of teardrop-shaped creatures roughly 30 cm (1 ft) in height, with a single blue eye in the middle of their bodies. SCP-131-A is burnt orange in color while SCP-131-B is mustard yellow. At the base of each creature is a wheel-like protrusion which allows for locomotion, suggesting that the creatures may be biomechanical in origin. The subjects can move surprisingly fast, covering over 60 m (200 ft) in a matter of seconds. The subjects, however, lack a braking system, which has led to some rather spectacular, if not overly amusing, mishaps involving the creatures. The subjects have also shown the ability to climb sheer surfaces, and have gotten lost in the air vents on more than one occasion.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-131/131volgun.png,,,,,,,
132,Safe,1," SCP-132 takes the form of a series of ¦¦¦ glass tetrahedrons, each with a side length of 10.3 centimeters. Each instance of SCP-132 appears to contain a patch of desert sand. Occasionally scorpions and other desert creatures enter the confines of an instance of SCP-132 as if it were a continuous piece of desert. Creatures within SCP-132 have shown no awareness of the existence of anything outside of the object and attempts to influence the area within SCP-132 have failed.",,,,,,,,
133,Safe,1," SCP-133 are a set of six hundred and thirteen (613) black, circular pieces of a waxy, paper-like material 5 cm in diameter. When placed against a solid surface and rubbed, SCP-133 will instantaneously ""transfer"" to the surface and create a circular hole. Testing has shown that SCP-133 is capable of penetrating up to 61 cm of structural grade steel, though the exact degree of penetration is reduced by extremely smooth or highly dense materials. Examination of holes created by SCP-133 show that they are superficially smooth, but exhibit tool marks consistent with that of extremely fine boring implements at a microscopic level. The exact mechanism by which SCP-133 operates is still under investigation.",,,,,,,,
134,Safe,1," SCP-134 seems to be an Asian girl between the ages of ¦ and ¦, with short black hair and a slight build. The subject seems normal in most respects and has all the biological requirements of a human child (food, sleep, etc). However, where SCP-134's eyes should be are two black pits, covered by a transparent membrane similar in appearance to a human eye's membrane; ophthalmological testing has shown that the membranes are between 150 and 200 times more resilient than those of a normal, non-anomalous human. SCP-134 lacks eyelids and thus does not blink, nor can SCP-134 see anything through these black areas. Attempts to examine the back of SCP-134's eyeball have failed, as no retina can be seen. In normal lighting conditions, they appear completely black, but in darkness, very faint lights have been seen within them. Further study with long-exposure photography and light amplification revealed that the lights are actually stars and galaxies, visible as though SCP-134's eye sockets are somehow looking out into deep space. To date, no astronomical formations have been recognized, though research by staff astronomer Dr. ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ is ongoing.",http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-134/SCP-134.jpg,,,,,,,
135,Euclid,2," SCP-135 is a human female between ¦ and ¦¦ years of age that promotes rapid, uncontrolled cell growth within a radius of 2.25 metres from itself. It remains rigidly in the foetal position, and has never been observed to move. SCP-135's effect is carcinogenic to animal tissue and induces malignant neoplasia in plant and fungal tissues in 100% of recorded exposure cases, with severity and disorganization increasing exponentially with closer proximity to SCP-135. Within 0.1 metres, cells will not die, even under conditions where they would normally, causing SCP-135 to be steadily buried under a continually-growing mass of plant matter, fungal matter, and micro-organisms. This “undying” state extends to SCP-135's cells as well. SCP-135 has been shown to lack an epidermis, instead having a crust of mixed plant and fungal matter that has incorporated itself onto SCP-135's skin, interspersed with tumours and patches of raw dermis.",,,,,,,,
136,Euclid,2, SCP-136 has no effect on non-humans.,,,,,,,,
137,Euclid,2," SCP-137 is an entity with the ability to possess a toy, gaining the physical properties, size, and shape of whatever it represents; for example, a teddy bear will become an actual bear, and behave accordingly. SCP-137 cannot possess any miscellaneous object, only toys. The observed range of SCP-137's possessive effect is two hundred fifty (250) meters, but until further testing has been accomplished, SCP-137 is assumed to have a maximum range of five hundred (500) meters from its position.",,,,,,,,
138,Safe,1," SCP-138 is a human male, suspected to be in excess of four thousand (4000) years old. Subject is approximately 1.5 meters in height, emaciated, and wizened. SCP-138's precise origins are unknown. Subject was discovered in 2006, in an Egyptian tomb located near Tutankhamen's tomb unearthed in 1922, sealed inside a sarcophagus. When a living being was discovered in the tomb, the Foundation was alerted by one of our sleeper agents assigned to the International Archaeological Association. Subject was immediately moved to Sector 37 for investigation by the lead research science team there.",,,,,,,,

140,Keter,3," SCP-140 is a modern hardcopy book with an unremarkable black binding and an unknown number of white pages. The book jacket is missing, but the title, “A Chronicle of the Daevas”, is clearly legible. The inside cover is signed by the author, whose name is indecipherable. The text is copyrighted 19¦¦. Careful examination reveals there are far more pages between the bindings than could be contained within them.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-140/daevas.jpg,,,,,,,
141,Safe,1," SCP-141 is a small leather-bound codex dating back to Roman times, easily carried in one hand. Despite its great age, it never acquires any additional signs of wear and tear beyond a somewhat aged-looking cover. Its thin papyrus pages are always crisp, and so far have proven difficult to tear from the codex’s binding. All attempts at radiocarbon dating have failed; the judgment of SCP-141 as being Roman in origin was initially based upon its appearance, but later confirmed through extensive research using SCP-141 corroborated by historical records. The title is apparently  Codex Damnatio , based upon the text on its spine.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-141/SCP-0141.jpg,,,,,,,
142,Safe,1," SCP-142 closely resembles a 1940’s “Black Beauty” slot machine, as produced by the Mill corporation during that era. The only observed irregularity in the external construction of SCP-142 is found in the coin slot of the device, which has been modified to accept any item that will fit in a cylindrical space 5.00 cm in length and 2.45 cm in diameter.",,,,,,,,
143,Euclid,2," SCP-143 is a plantation of 300 specimens of a unique type of tree. The trees are similar in appearance to  Prunus  x  yedoensis  (Japanese Sakura), or cherry blossoms. They bear no fruit, and the only known way of reproduction is by careful ""own root"" propagation using cut saplings from an older sample.",,,,,,,,
144,Safe,1," Located in a monastery atop a small Tibetan mountain, SCP-144 is a thin, taut hempen rope, only 1.2 cm thick, attached to a ring of jade bound to the floor of an atrium in the temple (known as ""Base Camp"" amongst researchers). The other end of SCP-144 extends straight upward many kilometers up into the sky to a yet-to-be-explored satellite in geostationary orbit above the Earth at an altitude of about 39 km (over 22 miles away, known as ""the Summit"" amongst researchers).",,,,,,,,
145,Euclid,2," SCP-145 appears to be a standard 2002-model cordless telephone handset of Alcatel brand on its standard issue charging base. The charging base appears defaced; all jack inputs are sealed with resin glue and the power input to the device has been gouged out with an unknown sharp tool. Serial number and production date are unavailable as all labels and stickers have been ripped off or defaced. The phone rings constantly whether it is on the base or not regardless of the lack of power source. Tests have shown the battery is removable, and disassembly of the base has not shown any effect on the hand unit. The hand unit itself has had all the seams sealed, preventing conventional disassembly. When answered a female voice speaks on the phone in a voice that shows high levels of stress. This voice varies from conversation to conversation, but in all cases the voice expresses extreme panic, and proceeds to plead with the listener for assistance as she describes instances of torture conducted on unknown victims. In the background, the listener will hear sounds of violence and expressions of pain and anguish. Audio analysis has so far indicated at least ¦¦ individual voices over disparate calls. The methods of torture implied thus far (judging from the phrases and reactions of those speaking at the time of contact) have included branding, electrocution, laceration, sexual assault, [DATA EXPUNGED] and dismemberment.",,,,,,,,
146,Euclid,2," SCP-146 is a hollow bronze head, apparently a fragment of a complete statue or bust, depicting a crowned young woman or perhaps an effeminate young man. The head exhibits severe verdigris over much of its surface. The crown of SCP-146 is inlaid with silver decorations, and its eyes (the apparent source of SCP-146's effects) are beaten silver, shined to be mildly reflective. To date, SCP-146 has not exhibited any signs of movement, but its reaction to certain decor in its containment area indicates that it may possess a degree of sentience, if not outright sapience. If SCP-146 is able to communicate, it has not yet done so.",,,,,,,,
147,Euclid,2," Discovered 1983 in a civilian home in Detroit, Michigan. SCP-147 appears to be a 1957 General Electric brand black-and-white television, model 17TO26. SCP-147 has been observed to exhibit two different behaviors:",,,,,,,,
148,Euclid,2," SCP-148 is a metallic substance, composed of a variety of known and unknown elements. The total mass of SCP-148 on hand is approximately  1.1  1.2 tonnes. SCP-148 has a gray-green color with a bluish tinge and oxidizes readily in the presence of water. SCP-148 has a melting transition point of approximately 4500°C and a boiling transition point of approximately 9000°C. SCP-148 has a density of  6.20 g/cm 3  6.76 g/cm 3  and qualifies as HRC 39 in a Rockwell hardness test. It exhibits material properties, such as strength, ductility, and workability, similar to platinum.",,,,,,,,
149,Keter,3," SCP-149 is a breed of mosquito which carries a strain of retrovirus (herein referred to as SCP-149-A) that mutates regenerating human cells into fertilized mosquito eggs. SCP-149-A is injected directly into the bloodstream when SCP-149 feeds. The SCP-149-A quickly works on the nucleus of the cells, warping the DNA. The first set of cells bred from these changed instructions closely resemble cysts, and are concentrated in the lining of the esophagus and the sinuses. Upon dissection, however, these 'cysts' are revealed to be filled with SCP-149's larvae, the cysts acting as a protective casing against external forces. SCP-149 appears to go through its maturation cycle in a matter of hours; by the time the subject is able to feel any effects, the first generation of SCP-149 has already grown inside the subject's body. SCP-149 primarily achieves exodus through the mouth and nostrils, occasionally being diverted through the Sphenoid sinuses to escape through the eye sockets. Infection by SCP-149 is fatal, and chance of infection has been estimated to be 50% from one bite.",,,,,,,,
150,Keter,3," SCP-150 is an obligate parasite that resembles the tongue-eating louse ( Cymothoa exigua ), but is adapted to form conjunctive symbiotic relationships with humans for a period of its lifespan. Upon contact with a human subject, SCP-150 embeds itself deeply in the flesh of its host. Over the course of approximately seven days, the parasite will burrow into the host and affect numerous physiological alterations.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-150/isopod.jpg,,,,,,,
151,Euclid,2," SCP-151 is a 1 m x 1.3 m (3 ft x 4 ft) oil painting, apparently from the perspective of someone underwater. A subject who views the painting exhibits no initial effects. However, over a period of 24 hours, the subject's breathing becomes increasingly labored, culminating in the death of the subject. Autopsies reveal that subjects' lungs have filled with seawater. Attempts to halt the drowning process by medical intervention have proven successful in prolonging the life of the subject, but have not stopped nor reversed the condition.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-151/SCP-151(1).jpg,,,,,,,
152,Safe,1," SCP-152 is a large, hardbound book with leather bindings. The paper inside resembles vellum and is written upon in black ink. The contents of the book consist entirely of a series of entries that describe apocalyptic events, which are not always XK-class end-of-the-world scenarios but invariably deal with the extinction of humanity. The entries are arranged in chronological order, beginning with an unexplained spontaneous failure of the sun in 6000 BC and ending with other events close to the present day. Many of the entries describe apocalypses caused or facilitated by objects that are or were in Foundation custody, or are of a paranormal nature. There are also records of human extinction caused by more ""conventional"" means, such as nuclear warfare or deadly viral epidemics. Each entry describes in some detail the events leading up to the calamity itself, and the aftermath until the point at which the last human on Earth dies.",,,,,,,,
153,Euclid,2," SCP-153 appears to be a species of nematode (roundworm) that can reach up to ¦¦ m in length and ¦¦ cm in diameter. Specimens of SCP-153 live in sewers and drain pipes, and while specimens of SCP-153 can live off of most any organic material, they prefer to consume animal tissue.",,,,,,,,
154,Euclid,2," SCP-154 is a pair of simple bronze bracelets, completely circular and large enough to comfortably hang off the arm of most people. Spectrograph analysis has proven that the item is composed entirely of copper (85%), tin (11%), arsenic (3%), and traces of other slight impurities (<1%).",,,,,,,,
155,Safe,1," SCP-155 is a complex electronic construct consisting of a highly modified Cray CS6400 supercomputer, a dedicated radioisotope thermoelectric generator, and a device that has yet to be fully reverse-engineered. SCP-155 was recovered from the basement of Prometheus Labs' primary research laboratory by elements of Mobile Task Force Mu-4 (""Debuggers"") following the destruction of the facility and subsequent Foundation intervention.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-155/scp155-1_th.jpg,,,,,,,
156,Euclid,2," SCP-156 is a group of exactly 181 pomegranate arils. The number of instances of SCP-156 is constant. When one is ingested or destroyed, it is replaced instantaneously with a new one among the largest group of contiguous instances. Otherwise, the instances can be moved around freely. After leaving the group (i.e. after an instance is touching no other instance), the instance will spoil normally, after which a new instance will appear. When all instances are destroyed simultaneously, all 181 instances reappear randomly at the location of one of the destroyed arils. Attempts to measure the time between destruction of one instance and the appearance of a new one using high-speed cameras have so far failed.",,,,,,,,
157,Euclid,2," SCP-157 is a previously unknown microscopic animal in the Tardigrade phylum, adapted to live on land as a predator. Like other Tardigrades, SCP-157 is extremely resistant to environmental damage, and can enter a cryptobiotic state when no food is present. SCP-157 normally exists as an amorphous mass composed of millions of individual organisms. In this form, it can slowly crawl and climb.",,,,,,,,
158,Euclid,2," SCP-158 is a large mechanical arm, similar to one that one might find in an automotive factory, although the end attachment is unusually shaped, resembling a pointed tridactyl claw. Its optimal placement is to be installed and suspended upside down, its base attached to the ceiling in a room that has been built to accommodate. A series of cables are protruding from the base and some are connected to a complex mobile console, complete with VDU (Visual Display Unit) and full keyboard. The others should be connected to a working power supply if the device is to be operated successfully. At the bottom of the console, there is a dispensing device, with attachments for a container roughly 7.6 cm (3 in) in width, and 17.8 cm (7 in) in height.",,,,,,,,
159,Safe,1," SCP-159 has the appearance of a standard neon sign reading 'OPEN', of the style commonly found in small businesses. When SCP-159 is displayed through a window of a building, and deactivated by removing it from a standard power outlet 1 , the building will become impossible to enter by any means. The locking effect ceases immediately when SCP-159 is reattached to a power outlet. If SCP-159 is switched OFF and then removed from its power outlet, its effect will not activate.",,,,,,,,
160,Euclid,2," SCP-160 appears to be a quadriflyer unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with a diameter of approximately 1.1 m at its widest point, similar to the [REDACTED] model manufactured by the [REDACTED] Corporation. It is devoid of any identifying marks or manufacturing labels, though visual inspection of SCP-160 has revealed signs of scratches and other superficial damage indicating that prior identifying labels may have been removed.",,,,,,,,
161,Euclid,2," There are currently three copies of SCP-161 in Foundation control. SCP-161 appears to be a brightly colored, plastic, child's pinwheel, with a ""The Factory"" Stamp on the back.",,,,,,,,
162,Euclid,2," SCP-162 is a mass of fish hooks, fish line, needles, scissors, and other sharp objects in a rough ball shape close to 2.4 m (8 ft) in width and 2.1 m (7 ft) in height. After being in SCP-162's vicinity, subjects have reported feeling drawn to the object in order to touch it. This desire can extend for several weeks after seeing the item, becoming an obsession in many cases. The ""draw"" increases the more SCP-162 is observed, and subjects will become violent towards anyone attempting to restrain or remove them from SCP-162.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-162/scp162.jpg,,,,,,,
163,Safe,1," SCP-163 is a sapient organism of extraterrestrial origin. When standing, it is 2 m tall and 1.5 m wide, the bulk of the body being suspended 50 cm from the ground. The body is roughly cylindrical with a circular mouth at the bottom, the equivalent of a head at the top, and eight three-jointed legs arranged radially around the equator. SCP-163 also has a series of specialized limbs, listed here:",,,,,,,,
164,Euclid,2," SCP-164 is a strain of cancerous cells that causes sarcoma-like tumors in host bodies. While cell DNA appears to be primarily derived from human DNA, the cells now effectively exist as unicellular, asexually-reproducing parasites. Several characteristics make SCP-164 remarkable:",,,,,,,,
165,Keter,3," The organic component of SCP-165 resembles that of typical parasitic mites, seven hundred fifty (750) micrometers in length, with eight (8) legs and a genetic structure similar to the house dust mite. The main difference is the hermit-crab-like behavior of attaching grains of sand to its back. It is unknown what purpose the sand serves, but the massive colony of SCP-165 numbers in the hundreds of billions to possibly trillions, creating a rather large dune.",http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-165/165-1.png,,,,,,,
166,Euclid,2," SCP-166 is a European female human in its late teens with ungulate features; possessing antlers, hooved feet, and a short tail reminiscent of  Rangifer tarandus  (Common reindeer). Despite these obvious abnormalities, DNA analysis reveals no abnormal genetic traits.",,,,,,,,
167,Safe,1," SCP-167 is a cube measuring approximately 10 meters on its edge, created from an unidentified shiny white-plastic polymer. Affixed to one of the faces of the cube is a large metal door. It is unknown if this door is part of the original SCP, or if it was affixed by someone else before the object was acquired by the SCP Foundation. The interior dimensions of this cube are identical to the exterior, minus several centimeters for the width of the cube — except that two of the remaining three walls each have doorways in them. These doorways lead directly to identical rooms, each with two more doorways leading to more identical rooms. This pattern continues for as far as the research teams have been able to determine. The placement of these doorways appears to be random; no pattern has been found that explains which two of the three remaining walls have doors.",,,,,,,,
168,Safe,1," Found resting on a desk during clearance of the condemned ¦¦¦¦¦¦ Elementary School building in 199¦, SCP-168 is a Hewlett-Packard brand graphing calculator, model #HP-28C. Upon initial inspection, it was discovered that the name “Eric” was carved into the inside of the removable casing. However, upon inputting a simple equation (6÷3) and pressing the “=” button, the screen of the device went blank for 3 minutes and 34 seconds, after which the “alternate key” function engaged, displaying the message; “WHAT TIME IS IT?”",,,,,,,,
169,Keter,3," SCP-169 is surmised to be a marine arthropod of enormous size, known as the ""Leviathan"" by generations of sailors and oral history. Presumed at first to be a myth, SCP-169 was detected on ¦¦/¦¦/19¦¦ by Mobile Task Force Gamma-6 during an investigation of paranormal activity around the ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ archipelago (coordinates ¦¦°¦¦'S ¦¦°¦¦'W). During ?-6's investigation, Dr. ¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ [?6-0912] discovered the archipelago to have moved at least three (3) kilometers from its original location. Though initially Dr. ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ believed this motion to be due to unusually-quick continental drift, a reconnaissance mission performed by the USS ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ revealed the archipelago to be the protrusions of rock-like plates covering an enormous organic mass. The Foundation was brought in immediately to begin threat management.",,,,,,,,
170,Safe,1," SCP-170 appears to be a standard tube of superglue, in a yellow tube 13 cm long. There is no manufacturer information or any other text on the outside of the container, apart from the word 'SUPERGLUE' printed in bold letters on the front.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-170/xray.jpg,,,,,,,
171,Euclid,2," Originally, SCP-171 was thought to be a colony of microscopic organisms similar to  SCP-968  or  SCP-165 , but further investigations revealed SCP-171 to be a single entity spanning 300 square meters when first encountered. SCP-171 is a web-like matrix of small, fine tendrils of neurons, mucous glands, and muscle fibers suspended in a frothy foam of its own creation. It is not capable of self-locomotion and does not actively attack or feed on other living organisms; rather, it attempts to form a symbiotic relationship with all organisms it comes into contact with.",,,,,,,,
172,Euclid,2," SCP-172 appears to be a human being, 34 years of age, 185 cm (6 ft 1 in) tall, black hair and mustache, 175.5 kg (386 lb), and of Russian descent. SCP-172's personality is very friendly and intelligent, if somewhat dull and repetitive. SCP-172 prefers dress from the 1860s, and always wears a large, ornate key on a long necklace. SCP-172 has never identified itself by any name, and is not upset by being referred to by its designation number.",,,,,,,,
173,Euclid,2," Moved to Site-19 1993. Origin is as of yet unknown. It is constructed from concrete and rebar with traces of Krylon brand spray paint. SCP-173 is animate and extremely hostile. The object cannot move while within a direct line of sight. Line of sight must not be broken at any time with SCP-173. Personnel assigned to enter container are instructed to alert one another before blinking. Object is reported to attack by snapping the neck at the base of the skull, or by strangulation. In the event of an attack, personnel are to observe Class 4 hazardous object containment procedures.",,,,,,,,
174,,4," SCP-174 is a wooden ventriloquial figure measuring 53 cm from head to toe, with somewhat ragged clothing and slight damage to several sections. Judging by the item's style and state of repair, it dates from the early 20th Century. The eyes and mouth of SCP-174 can be manipulated by means of a mechanism inside the figure.",,,,,,,,
175,Safe,1," When not “active,” SCP-175 resembles a yellowed piece of parchment, slightly larger than a standard piece of paper. The edges are torn, and it appears weathered and brittle. However, SCP-175 is actually quite supple and is indestructible despite its worn appearance, having resisted all attempts to remove pieces for testing.",,,,,,,,
176,Euclid,2," SCP-176 is an abandoned chemical factory situated near [DATA EXPUNGED]. The building consists of a factory floor and an observation room on the second floor, separated from the main room by one-way mirrors. There are three entrances to the building:",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-176/scp176.jpg,,,,,,,
177,Safe,1," SCP-177 is an eight by eight square standard chess board measuring 40 cm by 40 cm. On the board are 16 pawns, two Kings, two Queens, four Bishops, four Knights, and four rooks, totaling 16 black and 16 white pieces. All items are carved out of elephant ivory. The white pieces are moveable, and can even be removed from the board with minimal force; the black pieces, however, cannot be removed from the board, or moved by any outside force; forces in excess of 3 kilo-newtons have been applied to the black pieces, only resulting in damaged equipment.",,,,,,,,
178,Euclid,2," SCP-178 is a pair of white stereoscopic (“3-D”) glasses with a rectangular white cardboard frame and lenses of transparent blue and red (left and right lenses, respectively) plastic. The item exhibits no unusual physical properties apart from a slight discoloration of the cardboard consistent with age. When worn, the wearer begins perceiving large bipedal entities in addition to its ordinary surroundings. Entities reportedly exhibit a docile and occasionally curious behavior (reports include entities leaning over the shoulder of persons working and observing them with interest), with one exception. Any attempt by the wearer or  any other personnel  (see Incident Report #178-14-Alpha) to directly interact with the entities results in severe lacerations suddenly appearing on persons involved. The appearance of lacerations is rapid and continues until the moment the wearer expires. The pattern of lacerations is always consistent with being slashed with three (3) parallel, tapered sharp objects of lengths varying between 14.2 and 27.4 cm and maximum thickness varying between 2.9 and 8.1 cm. Recording and measuring devices used during testing failed to detect any anomalies, including while lacerations were appearing on subject(s). Subjects do not report hearing any sounds emanating from the entities. Long-term observation of subjects exposed to the item reveals no lasting effects. Stereoscopic images viewed through the item appear three-dimensional.",,,,,,,,
179,,6," SCP-179 is a humanoid entity located at a constant distance of approximately 40,000 km from the South polar region of the solar photosphere, locked to the rotation axis of Sol. However, it does not orbit it; the most recent recordings of SCP-179 indicate that it seems to maintain a continuous orbit around the center of the galaxy.",,,,,,,,
180,Euclid,2," SCP-180 appears as a hat or other form of head wear or hair accessory. Any individual who places SCP-180 on their head will have their identity 'stolen' by the hat. This effect causes the original host to be completely unrecognizable, even to people strongly familiar with the subject. Individuals observing a subject who has had their identity stolen will only be able to vaguely describe features of the individual such as hair and eye color, skin tone, and clothing, but will not be able to recognize the identity of the subject. Host subjects are unable to convince others of their identity. This effect lasts until SCP-180 has selected a new host.",,,,,,,,
181,Safe,1," G¦¦¦¦ O¦¦¦¦¦¦, formerly LvD-87465, had been incarcerated for repeated offenses of defrauding the Nevada Gaming Commission. Following the 18th month of his life sentence, he was quietly moved to Armed Reliquary Containment Area-02, where he was initiated and assigned a Level D clearance. His first exposure experiment was with SCP-¦¦¦, and the results were bloody but expected. When LvD-65468 was exposed to SCP-¦¦¦, he rampaged and killed those in the room, but SCP-181 was spared when an armed response team put down LvD-65468.",,,,,,,,
182,Euclid,2," SCP-182 is a Caucasian male, of average build, roughly 45 years of age, and has suffered heavy abdominal and cranial scarring at an unspecified point in the past (by subject's own admission, shortly before he was admitted into the care of the Foundation in 19¦¦). SCP-182 is both deaf and mute, compensating for these disabilities with natural abilities.",,,,,,,,
183,Euclid,2," SCP-183 is an unknown biological entity that is, for all intents and purposes, invisible. Evidence of its existence comes mainly in the form of monofilament wires which the organism apparently synthesizes. These fibers are extremely thin and durable; they are capable of slicing through soft tissue, bone, and even body armor with very little force. Coupled with the difficulty of seeing them, this constitutes a serious hazard to all personnel within the container. Organic material left within the container disappears at a rate of approximately 4 kg per day, an indication that the organism is omnivorous.",,,,,,,,
184,Euclid,2," SCP-184 is a small, smooth metallic object, 10 cm (4 in) tall and 10 cm (4 in) wide, in the shape of a dodecahedron. Each face of the figure has a circular hole in the center, and a small sphere is attached to each vertex. SCP-184 is made of an unknown, but highly magnetic, alloy about as hard as brass.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-184/dodecahedron-new.png,,,,,,,
185,Safe (Euclid class considered after incident 185-1. See document 185-1 for details.),5," SCP-185 appears to be a Russian R-105M radio used during the Cold War, except that it has a crudely-added keypad and LCD screen. The object can receive most radio transmissions, including encrypted signals. Attempts to determine how it can break even the strongest of encryptions have so far been fruitless. SCP-185 has a very long range, surpassing even modern radio equipment. It functions as a normal radio until input is added via the keypad. It seems that if a year is entered into the keypad, the radio will receive transmissions from the specified era (depending on if messages were being broadcast on the set frequency). This function was discovered when, upon entering the random number of 1939, Neville Chamberlain was heard declaring war on Germany. The possibility of experimenting with dates and times has been noted and is being researched. The possibility of entering future dates is being discussed; it has yet to be decided whether the benefits outweigh the risk of causing a time paradox. On the inside, the radio appears to be unaltered, and the keypad is contained in a box affixed to the side of the radio. Researchers cannot access the keypad due to the box being made from a metal that is yet to be identified. It cannot be cut and there are no determinable ways to disassemble it.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-185/105mb2yy9.jpg,,,,,,,
186,Euclid,2," SCP-186 is the site of an unrecorded military engagement occurring from 7/24/1917 to 8/13/1917 between elements of the Imperial German Army and forces of the Russian provisional government as part of the larger conflict of World War I, and the continuing effects resulting from its aftermath. This conflict came to be known to its participants as the Battle of Husiatyn Woods in surviving accounts.",,,,,,,,
187,Safe,1," SCP-187 is a Caucasian female, early to mid 20s, 180 cm tall, weighing 40 kg (approx 88 lb).  She is suffering from severe malnutrition, and must be fed intravenously, as she refuses to eat any food given to her.  She is recovering from the effects of severe malnutrition.",,,,,,,,
188,Safe,1," SCP-188 is a volume of iridium metal hosting an effect that acts on a finite region around the object. With the exception of the regional effect, SCP-188 is, chemically and physically, an otherwise unremarkable sample of iridium metal. SCP-188 has a mass of 181.43 g and has been cast as a cylinder, with a radius of 1 cm and a length of 2.56 cm. SCP-188's current cylindrical shape is not its original form, but one convenient for experimental manipulation and storage.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-188/scp188.jpg,,,,,,,
189,Safe,1," SCP-189 is a species of parasitic roundworm (tentative taxonomic classification [DATA EXPUNGED]) capable of infesting any mammalian life form. Infection most commonly occurs as a result of direct skin contact with one or more egg sacs. These egg sacs are covered with microscopic ""hooks"" similar to those on the cuticles of some species of nematode, which anchor the sacs to the skin's surface. Contact with sebum then prompts the eggs inside to hatch, at which time the larvae seek out and burrow into one or more nearby hair follicles.",,,,,,,,
190,Safe,1," SCP-190 is a carved wooden box banded with iron, measuring 50 cm x 70 cm x 35 cm. The lid is carved with a representation of a large circus tent with an open central panel, within which stands  a figure dressed as a stereotypical ringmaster.  The carvings on the sides consist of assorted animals typically associated with circuses, including lions, tigers, bears, elephants, and horses. These carvings move at a maximum observed rate of approximately 5 mm per day and time-lapse monitoring indicates that the depicted creatures appear to be acting in a non-violent play behavior with each other.",,,,,,,,
191,Safe,1," SCP-191 is a female human child, approximately ¦ years old. It is believed to have been a test subject of several experimental surgeries performed by the late Dr. ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ (see below).",,,,,,,,
,,5," SCP-192 is a vacuum x-ray tube that forms the primary component of a diagnostic x-ray machine manufactured by ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ on ¦¦-¦¦-20¦¦, with diagnostic use commencing on ¦-¦¦-20¦¦. This machine was designated SCP-192-1. When an image is produced by a machine with SCP-192 inside, the area examined on the subject will be modified via unknown means to match the image eventually produced. This has the effect of introducing or removing injuries or disease from the subject, in accordance with the image.",,,,,,,,
193,Safe,1," SCP-193-01 is consistent in external appearance with a box of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ brand facial tissue. The bottom folds of the box are abnormally complex, and house a previously unknown soft-bodied invertebrate. The creature's genetics suggest that it is a member of phylum Mollusca, but do not match any more specific known taxonomic classification. The ""cardboard"" of the box has proven to be a highly specialized shell generated and maintained by the organism, which will gradually repair damage to the box if able. As compared with cardboard the shell is many times less flammable and more durable, but is by no means indestructible.",,,,,,,,
194,Safe,1," SCP-194 is a red-painted rowboat, designed to seat two people.",,,,,,,,
195,Euclid,2," SCP-195 is a ""medicinal whiskey"" sold by a pair of traveling salesmen in the pre-Civil War South. Various historical sources agree that the ""whiskey"" was targeted primarily to the slavecatchers of that era, and was advertised as having ""mind-enhancing"" properties. These sources agree that the salesmen were often driven out of town when the side effects of their concoction were discovered, and were ""…hanged for their devilsh ways [ sic ]"" on at least two occasions.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-195/acidface.jpg,,,,,,,
196,Euclid/Keter,4," SCP-196 appears to be a middle-aged male, under two (2) meters tall, of African-American descent. He claims to be forty-seven years old. Subject has black hair and brown eyes. There are no abnormal physical characteristics. Subject displays all basic needs of a normal human being. Subject tested with an I.Q. of 109, well within normal parameters. Subject's psychological examination indicated that he suffers from institutionalization and Stockholm Syndrome in relation to the Foundation's security staff. SCP-196 demonstrates no Euclid-type or other abnormal abilities.",,,,,,,,
197,Safe,1," SCP-197 is a plant nursery and greenhouse located at ¦¦¦¦ ¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦. Currently the site is abandoned, although previous containment procedures were to maintain the location as a nursery. Most of the anomalous properties of SCP-197 are located within the glass structure of the greenhouse, although research conducted at the time of the site's abandonment suggests that SCP-197 has a wide sympathetic influence on the surrounding area, which has displayed a level of deterioration equal to SCP-197 itself.",,,,,,,,
198,Euclid,2," SCP-198 has taken numerous forms since coming into Foundation possession in 19¦¦. Since acquisition, SCP-198 has been observed to have had dozens of different forms including a Styrofoam cup, ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ brand glass beer bottle, ¦¦¦¦¦¦ and ¦¦¦¦-¦¦¦¦ brand aluminum soda cans, an oversized shot glass that read “One Tequila, Two Tequila, Three Tequila, Floor”, a plastic water bottle with a ¦¦¦¦¦ label partially peeled off, and [DATA EXPUNGED]. These forms always appear partially filled with the expected liquid a vessel of that type would contain.",,,,,,,,
199,Plant,3," SCP-199 is a species of fern within the Hymenophyllaceae family. SCP-199 is tangentially related to filmy ferns, but is more tolerant to temperature, humidity, pollution, and external damage. The rhizomes of the plants can attach to and grow on most solid surfaces. SCP-199’s appearance is similar of that of thallose liverworts, but its fronds are unique to its species.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-199/fern.jpg,,,,,,,
200,Euclid,2," SCP-200 is contained within a chrysalis measuring 172.4 cm in length from stem to tip, attached to a standard queen size bed frame and mattress. The chrysalis is a mottled brown in color, and analysis shows it to consist of several layers of silk, woven in such a way as to be coarse to the touch. The silk layers appear to be held together by [DATA EXPUNGED].",,,,,,,,
201,Euclid,2," SCP-201 appears to be a very old piece of medical equipment, superficially resembling an IV stand, but with many other glass and metal items attached to it. SCP-201 stands 1.8 m (6 ft) tall and has a mass of 36.5 kg (80 lbs). The metal portions are made of steel and brass, and various parts are connected with rubber tubing. The two “IV bags” are porcelain and are open at the top. SCP-201 was recovered in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ Hospital, in a long-unused storage area. No record of SCP-201 appears anywhere in hospital records.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-201/005.jpg,,,,,,,
202,Safe,1," SCP-202 is an Asian-British male, 41 years of age, who performs all actions in reverse. He does not appear to age in reverse, but speaks, eats, walks, and performs all other actions opposite to what is considered normal. SCP-202 speaks in reverse English with a British accent. Recording his speech and playing it backwards at a 1:1 speed allows for normal communication. The subject asserts that he was a normal individual living in Stockport, England, until he woke up one morning four years ago and found that every action he attempted to do, he did in reverse. He pledges that no matter how hard he tries, he is unable to carry out normal patterns of motion. He also claims to be unable to explain how he is able to walk backwards through crowded halls without bumping into others or other inexplicable acts.",,,,,,,,
203,Euclid,2," SCP-203 appears to at one time have been a Caucasian human male of indeterminate age. Subject is two and a half (2.5) meters tall (though it is theorized that the “skeletal” framework augments subject’s original height, as indicated by irregular musculature) and weighs approximately two-hundred (200) kilograms.",,,,,,,,
204,Keter,3," SCP-204-1 is a semi-organic nano-machine colony that follows SCP-204-2 as a form of protector. SCP-204-1 spends the majority of its time in a dispersed cloud, where it is almost impossible to perceive with normal human senses. However, if SCP-204-2 is put into danger, or if SCP-204-2 commands it to, SCP-204-1 will instantaneously materialize into a solid, physical form. The exact shape and nature of this form is subjective, depending wholly upon SCP-204-2's view, state of mind, and imagination. Despite its variable nature, SCP-204-1 has a number of common traits. These include: massive strength, large size, basic intelligence, perfect obedience to SCP-204-2, and the ability to regenerate itself after consuming living flesh. SCP-204-1 is vulnerable to conventional weaponry, and can be temporarily forced back into its dispersed state if enough damage is inflicted.",,,,,,,,
205,Euclid,2," SCP-205 is a pair of flood lamps used in photography. The light emitted by each lamp behaves in a manner unique to SCP-205 and passes completely through any surface that is not colored white. Once the light contacts a white surface it scatters and reflects as normal and loses any unnatural properties. If the light continues uninterrupted through any matter, otherwise casting no shadow, each lamp will display an unidentified young woman's shadow upon any flat white surface, such as the projection screen in Chamber 52. Whether or not this shadow corresponds to anyone living or dead has yet to be determined, although the shadow appears to re-enact a specific series of events leading up to the woman's death.",,,,,,,,
206,Euclid,2," SCP-206 is a Martian exploratory rover (Designation -  Invictus ) launched on 12/08/20¦¦ as part of a joint Russian Space Research Institute / European Space Agency effort. (Exact object specifications are listed in Document 206-AA1.) Despite a successful launch aboard a  Soyuz-FG  rocket, telemetry data was lost on 16/01/20¦¦, roughly halfway to Mars. Attempts to re-establish communication failed, and on 10/02/20¦¦ the craft was declared lost.",,,,,,,,
207,Safe,1," SCP-207 refers to a crate containing 24 Coca-Cola brand cola drinks. The bottles are designated SCP-207-A to -X. SCP-207-B is currently the active bottle for testing, and no other bottles are to be opened without authorisation from two Level 4 researchers. All bottles have been clearly labelled to aid identification. The liquid held inside these has been confirmed to be identical across all of SCP-207, and should not be ingested outside of supervised testing. The liquid has been classified as SCP-207-1, and is to be treated as a Class 2 chemical hazard. SCP-207-1 does not appear to alter with age; however, the active testing bottle should have its protective cover kept on outside of removing liquid for testing.",http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-207/SCP207.jpg,,,,,,,
208,Safe,1," SCP-208 appears to be a short, stout man of Egyptian heritage, possessing a great deal of hair over much of his body. Along his brow is a mane similar to a lion's in shape and color, which grows down to a significant beard. SCP-208 typically wears an Egyptian tunic, similar to that of typical Old Kingdom military, although occasionally this is replaced by modern military fatigues.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-208/scp208.jpg,,,,,,,
209,Euclid,2," SCP-209 appears to be a single-malt Scotch tumbler, 10 cm in height and with an 8 cm diameter at its widest point. The tumbler shows no manufacturer's marks, but does indicate signs of moderate to heavy use and light wear including a small chip missing from the rim. When not in the possession of a human subject, the tumbler contains approximately 88 to 91 ml (3 oz) of an unknown golden-brown, translucent liquid. This liquid cannot be siphoned, spilled, drained, evaporated, or otherwise removed from SCP-209 by any means other than a human subject taking hold of the tumbler and consuming the liquid. All Activator subjects debriefed following a sampling of the liquid produced by SCP-209 report it to be alcoholic in nature and providing of a sense of warmth, self-assurance, and general well-being. This effect has proven to be highly addictive, with methadone therapy currently holding the highest rates of success for detoxification from SCP-209's effects.",,,,,,,,
210,Safe,1," SCP-210 is a two-story mansion flooded to a depth of 4.35 meters with an unknown fluid substance. The substance, designated SCP-210-01, possesses a refractive index nearly identical to water. This fluid is invisible from the outside of SCP-210 and does not flow out of SCP-210 if a door or window is opened. Any living creature that comes into contact with SCP-210-01 enters a sleep-like state and begins drifting through SCP-210-01 as if neutrally buoyant. Beings trapped in this manner are designated SCP-210-02; to date, ¦¦ instances of SCP-210-02 have been cataloged by remote means. Instances of SCP-210-02 emit a constant stream of bubbles as if exhaling despite no source of air being identified and subjects appearing to breathe as normal. Subjects have been noted to move through SCP-210-01 slowly ""as if dancing."" It has not been determined if this is under the power of the subjects or of microcurrents within SCP-210-01.",,,,,,,,
211,Safe,1," SCP-211 is a two-story building located in an abandoned district of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, IA. Records from ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦'s archives heavily suggest that the building was originally a middle-class dwelling, belonging to G¦¦¦¦¦¦ S¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ (since deceased of natural cause). Since then, all furnishings have disappeared, save standard light fixtures and a radiator (pictured above). Note that several of these lights' switches have not been discovered, rendering them useless. Additionally, the building's topography has been nearly completely covered with an estimated ¦¦¦,¦¦¦ sheets of paper, hereafter collectively designated as SCP-211-1.",,,,,,,,
212,Safe,1," SCP-212 is a large medical device, with three large robotic arms. The arms have an extremely diverse array of attachments, but no storage area or power source has yet been found. Attachments slide into and out of the arms as needed, with over five hundred different attachments documented. SCP-212 is made of plastic, steel, and other common materials. In-depth analysis is pending, as any attempt by mechanical means causes violent action from SCP-212, and attempts by any biological means normally results with subject's “improvement”.",,,,,,,,
213,Euclid,2," SCP-213 is an adolescent humanoid male, 1.5 m tall, weighing 95 kg. SCP-213 is able to forcefully sever the bonds between atoms in any solid or semi-solid matter with physical contact. An intense flash of light is produced when doing so. SCP-213 can use any part of its body to manifest this effect, and has used it to disintegrate projectiles as they impact its body. Manifestation of this effect has proven to be extremely painful, with extended use causing enough pain to render SCP-213 unconscious.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-213/213.JPG,,,,,,,
214,Euclid,2," SCP-214 is male, age ¦¦, formerly Agent ¦¦¦¦¦ of the Foundation. Physical and mental changes were noted after investigation of Incident ¦¦¦ at ¦¦¦¦¦¦ Public Library, MA. Containment of SCP-214 is detailed in [REDACTED]. A physical examination of SCP-214 shows the replacement of most bodily fluids, including but not limited to blood, vitreous humor, seminal fluid, and cerebrospinal fluid, with a mercury-like substance. Chemical analysis shows that the substance is a suspension of complex organometallic compounds in a protein- and lipid-enriched serum, but so far, nothing more can be ascertained of its origins or purpose. Most bodily functions were observed to no longer be active in SCP-214, though the related organs still exist in a preserved state within the body cavity. This includes the brain, which no longer shows activity on electroencephalography. It shows notable selective regenerative properties, some injuries vanishing within moments of infliction while others remain unhealed, even after a period of time in which a normal human would have recovered. SCP-214 does not experience pain normally, instead reacting to it as pleasure with no regard to physical damage to its body. Objects have been noted to disappear in the vicinity of SCP-214. There is currently no known method of recovering lost items.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-214/Mercury2.jpg,,,,,,,
215,Safe,1," SCP-215 is a pair of prescription glasses designed to correct myopic vision. When worn, SCP-215 induces a belief in the wearer that inanimate objects are sentient and capable of communication with the wearer. The severity of this delusion varies from wearer to wearer, but generally strengthens over time if SCP-215 is worn regularly, and in the worst cases manifests as a severe case of obsessive-compulsive disorder, culminating in an irrational fear of all machines.",,,,,,,,
216,Safe,1, SCP-216 is a 35.6 cm (14 in) high iron safe with a multiple-dial combination lock. The lock has 7 dials each with numbers ranging from 0 to 9. The combination cannot be changed while the door is open. The weight of the device appears to fluctuate in an obtuse manner (see document 88-B).,,,,,,,,
217,Keter,3," SCP-217 is a virus, incurable by current means, with a rate of infectivity at 100%. It affects all organisms in the kingdom Animalia, and can be spread via touch or contact with bodily fluid. SCP-217 is very hardy, and can survive for years outside the host body. The progress of the infection is very slow, with some subjects going several years before manifesting any symptoms.",,,,,,,,
218,Euclid,2," SCP-218 is a predatory colonial organism weighing approximately 1800 kg, consisting of several hundred parasitic lampreys of the family Petromyzontidae, designated  Petromyzon anomalis . Individual  Petromyzon anomalis  specimens average between 50 and 90 cm in length, and are similar in appearance to the common sea lamprey, ( Petromyzon marinus ) with the primary exception of complex ultraviolet-spectrum skin patterning. Individual lampreys can break off from the primary mass and move under their own power, acting similar to non-anomalous specimens. These motile units will remain in the vicinity of SCP-218’s primary body, until captured and eaten by colony members. The central mass of SCP-218 contains the organism’s primary organs, as well as a muscular foot for locomotion. SCP-218 is capable of surviving out of water for up to an hour, though it is greatly inhibited in mobility.",,,,,,,,
219,Safe,1," SCP-219 is a mechanical device consisting primarily of an array of pistons, driven by an electric motor which can be powered by attaching it to a separate generator. The entire machine is supported by a thorium alloy frame. The outer frame of each of SCP-219's pistons are also made primarily of the same thorium alloy. Attached to the outside of SCP-219 is an ¦¦¦¦ IBM Desktop PC, keyboard, and monitor, all shielded with shock-absorbent foam to prevent damage to them by SCP-219's vibrations.",,,,,,,,
220,Safe,1," SCP-220 has the appearance of a multiracial, English-speaking human male. According to his birth certificate, he is 84 years old as of 05/15/12.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-220/oldcouple%20%281%29-new.jpg,,,,,,,
221,Safe,1," SCP-221 is a pair of tweezers made out of gold, made in the 16th or 17th century. After subject testing it was noted that the damaged areas which had been used to gather material samples were smaller than they had been prior to the test. It is currently theorized that SCP-221 uses the minute amounts of gold in the human body to regenerate damage to itself.",,,,,,,,
222,Euclid,2," SCP-222 designates an area of tunnels in the Dolomites Mountains, near Aviano, Italy. The site is close to the Church of St. Gregory, and Aviano Air Force Base is also nearby. The tunnels are filled with carved stone coffins; one coffin in particular has unusual properties, and some portion of the tunnels is also involved. The carvings in the tunnels appear very old and of fairly good workmanship.",,,,,,,,
223,Euclid,2," SCP-223 is a photo album, capable of holding thirty (30) photos, bound like a small hardcover book. The photos are attached to the pages with an unknown adhesive. It matches the appearance of a product made by ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ but lacks any brand label. “From danny with love” has been written on the back in blue ink.",,,,,,,,
224,Euclid,2," SCP-224 is a wooden grandfather clock, accented with a black lacquer and gold leaf. Markings, remotely observed, date its origin at the end of the 19th century. Though internal examination of its components has been done, the density and construction of its gears make method of function impossible to interpret.",,,,,,,,
225,Euclid,2," SCP-225-1 and SCP-225-2 are shiny gray metallic spheres of unknown origin and composition, each with a diameter of 0.681 meters.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-225/silversphere.jpg,,,,,,,
226,Safe,1," SCP-226 is a cardboard box, measuring roughly 30 cm x 20 cm x 4 cm. It has a lid that fits securely over the bottom half, as with any common puzzle box. The surface of the box is a deep black, with the word ""fear"" scrawled with white ink on the upper-right corner of its lid. Within the box are 1,000 cardboard puzzle pieces, each measuring roughly 2 centimeters in diameter, also considered SCP-226. When completed, the puzzle always forms in a rectangular shape. However, the design and order in which the pieces fit together change with use.",,,,,,,,
227,Safe,1," SCP-227 is a bronze clockwork device measuring 10 cm x 16 cm x 26 cm and weighing 5 kg. SCP-227 is somewhat similar in appearance to reconstructions of the ""Antikythera Mechanism"", an incomplete and heavily corroded Greek artifact thought to date from approximately 100 BCE. Unlike that artifact, SCP-227 was found intact and apparently fully functional. This is partly because SCP-227 was found on land at ¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦¦¦¦, instead of at the bottom of the Mediterranean, but the lack of significant damage is remarkable. Preliminary testing of SCP-227 shows that it may have some ability to repair itself over time. Further testing is pending approval from O5 level staff.",,,,,,,,
228,Safe,1," SCP-228 is a Polaroid photograph of variable appearance. It is apparent at this time that SCP-228 derives its subject matter from the subconscious mind of the viewer. The images produced are always visually clear, but vary in interpretive coherency. For example, one viewer may cause SCP-228 to manifest a clear portrait of that viewer's father, while another causes an image of a heart shaped object submerged in green fluid to [REDACTED]. The coherence of the image produced by SCP-228 appears to vary from subject to subject, and is theorised to have some connection to the viewer's emotional state.",,,,,,,,
229,Euclid,2," SCP-229 appears to be a mass of wires and cables. Superficially, they appear to be raw copper wire, insulated Ethernet cable, phone cable, power lines, and many other forms of electrical cable. The current mass weighs 94 kg at last measurement.",,,,,,,,
,,6,,,,,,,,,
231,Keter,3," SCP-231-7 is a ¦¦¦¦¦ female between ¦ and ¦¦ years of age, with [DATA EXPUNGED].  the King is in his courting clothes, the brides are in their beds. the unborn princes wait in sleep to raise their eager heads. 
SCP-231-1 through 7 were retrieved from ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦, following a police raid on a warehouse owned by an organization called the Children of the  Scarlet King  (see article on ¦¦-¦¦-¦¦¦¦ in the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦ newspaper, "" Police Raid Satanic Sex Cult, Save Seven ""). 24 hours after the rescue, SCP-231-1 (real name ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦) went into labor pains, giving birth three minutes later to SCP-¦¦ (¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦), causing a ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ event resulting in over ¦¦¦ confirmed casualties. Foundation Personnel immediately took possession of remaining SCPs 231-2 through 231-7 and, based on notebooks recovered from the cult, instituted Procedure 110-Montauk to prevent future occurrences.  the hens were in the henhouse and seven eggs did lay, till the fox crept in by dark of night and stole the eggs away.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-231/scp-blank.png,,,,,,,
232,Safe,1," SCP-232 is a mass-produced children's toy of early 1950s manufacture, composed primarily of tin and a battery-powered electric light apparatus, with an exterior painted to resemble a laser gun of the type featured in popular science fiction of the early 20th century. A hinged section at the base of SCP-232's handle opens to accept two standard AA alkaline batteries. When batteries have been installed correctly and the trigger is pulled, a small red electric light in the barrel lights up. SCP-232's cognition-affecting properties become active whenever SCP-232 is picked up and held or carried by a human being while it has working batteries installed.",,,,,,,,
233,Keter,3," SCP-233 is a 23-sided polyhedron, each face being made up of both an equilateral triangle and a straight line simultaneously. Because of the space-time altering nature of the object, the exact physical makeup of the object cannot be emulated in three-dimensional or two-dimensional form.",,,,,,,,
234,Euclid,2," SCP-234 is a species of organism of presumed extradimensional origin resembling fish measuring approximately 25 mm in length. SCP-234 does not appear to have any eyes or light-sensitive organs, but navigates via a highly evolved sense of echolocation. It maintains buoyancy via a gas-filled organ similar to a swim bladder which allows it to float in the air, and exhibits behavior consistent with an omnivorous scavenger organism, though to date it has not been observed consuming any terrestrial organic matter.",,,,,,,,
235,Safe,1, SCP-235 appear to be shellac phonograph records of the type commonly produced in the late 1920s. Each instance of SCP-235 has a white label with the title in black lettering. Each record contains a different song. They are as follows:,,,,,,,,
236,Keter,3," SCP-236 appears to be a swarm of near-microscopic crabs. Individuals match no known form of crustacean, and elements of their physiology appear to point to an artificial origin (See Document ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦). SCP-236 appears to operate under a form of collective intelligence or “hive mind”. This intelligence appears to grow when individual SCP-236 are in close proximity, and dissipate when they are divided.",,,,,,,,
237,Safe,1," SCP-237 is the collective designation of the physical remains of SCP-237-1, and of the set of instances of SCP-237-2 which it created. Prior to being taken into Foundation custody, SCP-237-1 appeared to be a human male of Japanese ethnicity, with falsified identity documents indicating an age of 24 years. It manifested the anomalous ability to endow instances of SCP-237-2 with sapience, sensoria, and independent mobility.",,,,,,,,
239,Keter,3," SCP-239 appears to be an 8-year-old girl, 1 meter in height and 20 kilograms in weight. Subject has shoulder-length blond hair. Upon closer inspection, the subject's eyes ""shimmer"" a gray-green shade. Subject seems to emit a previously undiscovered form of radiation, which has been named ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦. These waves seem to be harmless in low concentrations but in higher concentrations they could break down matter on a subatomic level.",,,,,,,,
240,Safe,1," SCP-240 is a handmade vehicle built by PoI-240 from the wreckage of a Lockheed P-38  Lightning  military aircraft, designed to travel through the air using breath as fuel. The object is made up of an octahedral base of metal bars and beams joined to four wheels and a central rotor, allowing the rotation of a mast to which two propellers are attached. The metal structure of SCP-240 has been assembled in such a way as to provide a place for a pilot to sit facing the rotor.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-240/240def.png,,,,,,,
241,Safe,1," SCP-241 appears as a normal book, 33 cm x 23 cm x 3.5 cm, entitled  Good Home Cooking . The cover of SCP-241 is a red and white checkerboard pattern, with the title in simple black letters on the front and spine. When open, SCP-241 contains 99 recipes, sorted into typical sections of a cookbook. Many of these recipes include a picture of the dish that is invariably appetizing, and a small percentage will call for rare or exotic ingredients.",,,,,,,,
242,Safe,1," SCP-242 is a swimming pool approximately 4.5 m wide by 9 m long with a depth ranging from 1 m deep on both ends to 1.5 m deep in the center and a total volume of approximately 53,000 liters. It has a dual waterfall feature, an in-pool vacuum unit, and stairs on one end.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-242/242-1.jpg,,,,,,,
,,5," SCP-243 is a mass of small dry-cell batteries, all fused at their negative terminals into an ellipsoid approximately 30 cm long by 10 cm diameter. The arrangement is semi-fluid: the batteries may be rearranged by applying gentle pressure, though it is far more difficult to remove them from the central cylinder.",,,,,,,,
244,Euclid,2," SCP-244-1 is a Tunisian-style earthenware jar, made of common ceramics mixed with traces of [DATA EXPUNGED] and decorated with silver filigree. The inside of SCP-244-1 always has an internal temperature of -37? and a 125% humidity, regardless of external conditions; persons handling SCP-244-1 invariably describe it as cold to the touch. SCP-244-1 includes a cap of identical make and style to the jar itself.",,,,,,,,
245,Safe,1, Please see  SCP-245-1.zip  for information relating to SCP-245.,,,,,,,,
246,Safe,1," SCP-246 is a 16-millimeter film projector. When activated, SCP-246's projection lamp lights up and the reels begin turning. When the projector is pointed at a screen or other white surface, a film appears, even though SCP-246's film (hereafter referred to as SCP-246-01) does not pass in front of the projection lamp.",,,,,,,,
247,Euclid,2," SCP-247 is a Bengal tiger ( Panthera tigris tigris ; adult female) which, to all observers, appears to be a harmless cat ( Felis catus ; juvenile female) with an orange-and-black striped coat resembling that of a tiger.",,,,,,,,
248,Safe,1," SCP-248 is a twenty-five (25) page booklet of stickers, each reading ""110%"" with a small pressed imprint of the words ""The Factory"" in the bottom right corner. The booklet itself is 7.5 cm in height and 15 cm in length. Each page of SCP-248 contains two (2) of the stickers, making a total of what would be fifty (50), but circumstances before its discovery have left only forty-nine (49) stickers.",,,,,,,,
249,Euclid,2," SCP-249 appears to be a windowless door, covered in a faded white paint. It was first found in a house located within the small town of ¦¦¦¦¦¦. When opened, SCP-249 does not lead to the other side of the doorway, but to a random door within eight hundred and fifty (850) meters. Items that go through SCP-249 are teleported to that other door, regardless of what may be between the door and SCP-249. When observed from the destination, the exit door appears to open on its own accord, and whatever goes through SCP-249 appears out of thin air. When opened, SCP-249 takes on the appearance of the door it is connected to. When shut, SCP-249 is no longer connected to that door, and reverts to its standard appearance.",,,,,,,,
250,Euclid,2," SCP-250 is the animate fossil skeleton of an allosaur (originally identified as  Allosaurus fragilis ; however, an incomplete scientific article found in the personal effects of paleontologist Dr ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ indicates that this classification may have been erroneous). It consists of 153 disarticulated bones, and 14 plaster-and-fiberglass replacements, held together and animated by an unknown force. Study of this force is hindered by SCP-250's aggressive behavior, which has been assessed by Foundation palaeozoologists as being well within theoretical norms for an allosaurus.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-250/SCP-250.jpg,,,,,,,
251,Euclid,2," Origin unknown. SCP-251 consistently appears to be a small snow globe. Attached is a series of photographs taken of the same artifact over time. This indicates that the snow globe is at least partially animate. However, when viewed directly by multiple people, there is no apparent movement except by a perpetual ""blizzard"". SCP-251 has not been moved since its arrival at Site-19, but the ""snowflakes"" have never ceased falling.",,,,,,,,
252,,5," SCP-252 is a sub-species of  Dosidicus gigas . Mature specimens are noticeably smaller than average, reaching no more than 1 m in length and weighing a maximum of 40 kg. Dissection shows the absence of an ink sac and an increased density of chromatophores (approx. 20 times the normal adult average).",,,,,,,,
253,Euclid,2," SCP-253 is a cluster of undifferentiated human cells, matching the physiological traits of cancer. As per cancerous cells, cultured samples of SCP-253 will grow indefinitely if given an adequate source of nutrition. SCP-253 is contagious, able to pass from human to human, as well as to some animal species. SCP-253 is not an airborne contagion, but physical contact with surface neoplasms on infected subjects will spread the plague.",,,,,,,,
254,Safe,1," SCP-254 is a rectangular wooden plaque measuring 22 cm x 30 cm and weighing approximately 1.5 kg. On the front of the plaque is an empty brass picture holder, as well as a printed metal plate with a black background and gold-colored letters reading “Employee of the Month.” Affixed to the back of the plaque is a standard hanging device.",,,,,,,,
255,Keter,3," SCP-255 is an anomalous infectious phenomenon of extraterrestrial origin, manifesting in most living subjects as a neurological disorder with varying symptoms. Eligible carriers of SCP-255 have thus far been observed to be organisms possessing a cerebral cortex with approximately =5.4 billion neurons. Experimentation has determined that species capable of contracting SCP-255 include humans, chimpanzees, African elephants, bottlenose dolphins, false killer whales, and others.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-255/eeg.png,,,,,,,
256,Euclid,2," Moved to Site 76 on 03-02-2007. SCP-256 is similar to a typewriter in most respects, except that the keys are fixed in position, rather than connected to levers, and instead of a rollbar and most of the machinery that should be present, two concave copper discs stand on either end, facing inward, 38 cm (15 in) apart. While invisible to the naked eye, EM readings show that a significant electrical charge passes between the copper discs without any conductive medium. If any of the prohibited items are brought into the containment chamber, this current increases in both amplitude and voltage, eventually arcing out and striking the object in question. This is also the reason reinforced concrete was not used in the chamber's construction, as rebar seems to agitate the artifact. It is unknown where the extra energy comes from, or even the initial current, as there seems to be no power generation source within SCP-256. If at any time this current oscillates more than the average peak of 26% on the EMR surveillance, all unauthorized personnel regardless of clearance level must immediately evacuate the chamber. Those who fail to comply are to be terminated at once, again, regardless of security clearance.",,,,,,,,
257,Euclid,2,,,,,,,,,
258,Safe,1," SCP-258 was recovered from ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, Maine after parents of local schoolchildren reported that stories of a 'sad bouncy frog' their children had been spreading were true. Agent F¦¦¦ confirmed the nature of the object and Foundation personnel replaced it with a replica without incident.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-258/scp-258.png,,,,,,,
259,Keter,3," SCP-259 is a fractal image known as ""The Weisenglass Spiral"". A completed rendering of SCP-259 acts as an Einstein-Rosen Bridge, opening a portal to an unknown location. The locations accessed appear to vary depending on the size and orientation of the rendered image, and have included:",,,,,,,,
260,Euclid,2," SCP-260 appears to be a small clastic rock whose exact composition is unknown. It possesses phenocryst-like formations that identify it as a form of igneous breccia. On one of the larger and smoother portions of the surface is inscribed the name of a human, transliterated into Cyrillic, which changes over time at well-defined intervals. SCP-260 maintains continuous motion along a geodesic across all objects that stand between it and the individual currently named on the stone (hereafter the ""target""). Its speed in a vacuum across a frictionless surface has been estimated at approximately 1.22 centimeters per second, but it usually moves much slower than this due to atmospheric and surface friction. (An accurate estimate is impossible, as SCP-260 is known to ""stick"" to the surface of whatever object it is currently located on, preventing its deposition in pure vacuum.)",,,,,,,,
261,Safe,1," SCP-261 appears to be a large black vending machine with no front glass panel, and a small keypad on the right side. SCP-261 was recovered in Yokohama, Japan. SCP-261 was brought to the Foundation’s attention after investigation of an “urban legend” about a “magic vending machine” that was circulating on the internet. SCP-261 was found in a back alley behind a large shopping center, with a hand-written sign saying “out of order” in Japanese taped to it. SCP-261 has no marks or identification of any kind, and no locals remember when or how it came to be in its current location.",,,,,,,,
262,Euclid,2," SCP-262 is a light brown, European military-style greatcoat from a period between the late 1500s to the early 1900s. It is without any specific designations or markings, leading researchers to believe it was an original archetype sample, intended to be submitted to military officials for approval as part of a new uniform design. The pattern was either rejected or lost because it was never implemented. It is made of wool and extends below the knee on most individuals. Carbon dating of the coat fibers has been inconclusive, placing the age of SCP-262 in the range of 6,200 to 6,400 years old. One explanation is that the wool used to create SCP-262 is perhaps thousands of years old, but the coat itself was cut, sewn, and assembled recently.",,,,,,,,
263,Safe,1," SCP-263 is a black and white television, bearing the logo of the ""THOMSON"" company. It matches no known model of television, but has a similar style and construction to televisions built in the year 1961. SCP-263 is fully intact, but has sustained minor cosmetic damage to the screen and frame. SCP-263 has been observed to function even when not connected to a power outlet.",,,,,,,,
264,Safe,1," SCP-264 is the preserved cadaver of a hominin 1  woman, dated to around 12,000 years old. It constantly hovers a few centimetres above the ground in a cross-legged position. It possess a unique Humic and Akivic signature, with elevated Hume measurements within its surroundings confirming its purpose as a form of anchor.",,,,,,,,
265,Euclid,2," SCP-265 appears to be a Series 1 GAZ M21 Volga automobile, devoid of any license plating, logos, or other identifying marks. It is painted black with white-rimmed wheels and appears to be in pristine condition, regardless of environment. Some accounts note that it has white curtains in all but the front windows. Note that the production of the GAZ M21 ceased in 1970, with Series 1 being produced between 1958-1959.",,,,,,,,
266,Euclid,2," SCP-266 is a number of free-floating masses of gaseous material, possessing a natural luminescence which exists as a bright purple or red glow. In most cases, SCP-266 feels cold to the touch, and exerts an endothermic effect on its immediate surroundings. Despite having no obvious nervous system, SCP-266 appears to react to stimuli and has been observed to learn certain habits based upon its experiences.",,,,,,,,
267,Euclid,2," SCP-267 are hairless, sightless, carnivorous rodents highly adapted for subterranean life in eusocial colonies. A single nest is currently contained in the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ cave formations in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦. SCP-267 is biologically similar to  Heterocephalus glaber , but represents a distinct subspecies.",,,,,,,,
268,Euclid,2," SCP-268 is a tweed-wool newsboy cap. The design and make seem to be of Irish origin. Due to the style and fabric, it is estimated to have been created in the late 1800's to early 1900's, though fiber analysis is inconclusive. The only markings on the cap are a small label with writing in Middle Irish, reading ""The Garden is the Serpent's Place."" However, there are various indications that this label was sewn onto the cap in recent times.",,,,,,,,
269,Safe,1," SCP-269 is an unmarked bracelet composed of red jade approximately 11 cm in diameter in its inactive state.

270,Euclid,2, SCP-270 is a nondescript black phone of mid-20th century make.,,,,,,,,
271,Keter,3," SCP-271 is a small disk, composition unknown but metallic in nature, a little more than 4 cm in diameter, and engraved with a number of symbols that may or may not represent an unknown alphabet. These symbols are infectious to their environment over time, gradually appearing as if invisibly carved into nearby objects. They are capable of escaping through any hole, however minute, but have been demonstrated to be unable to penetrate non-gaseous fluids. Objects that carry the symbols for a sufficient time begin to be changed on a molecular level to the same material as the SCP; both the engraving and petrification processes are extremely painful to biotic organisms. The only known method for purging the symbols is the destruction of the object, and it is not possible to do this to SCP-271 itself.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-271/infectiousinscription-new.jpg,,,,,,,
272,Safe,1," SCP-272 is an iron nail, approximately 11.5 cm long, resembling ancient designs. Covering every flat surface are engravings of unknown cultural origin. The engravings have been described as “captivating, but scary” in a majority of staff interviewed.",,,,,,,,
273,Euclid,2," SCP-273 resembles a middle-aged woman of Indian descent. DNA samples and medical tests indicate SCP-273 conforms to human normal in all other respects, despite the subject's abnormalities. SCP-273 feels no need to eat or drink, but is perfectly capable of doing so. SCP-273 has generally shown willing compliance and cooperation with the Foundation's containment and requests.",,,,,,,,
274,Keter,3," SCP-274 is a paint of variable color. Buildings inflicted with SCP-274 appear to have large amounts of graffiti covering the sides of the building, and often have large, disturbing designs to them (see addendum-274). While its consistency is that of normal paint, its composition reveals it to be 28% hemoglobin, 12% gastric acid, and 60% common components consistent with Krylon brand spray paint.",,,,,,,,
275,Safe,1," SCP-275 is a woman who cannot be physically damaged by any means available to the Foundation. Subject is of apparently Middle-Eastern origin and claims to have grown up 'somewhere in the Ottoman Empire', but to have been a homeless orphan with no memories before the age of approximately ten.

Subject is 1.63 m (5 ft 4 in) tall and weighs 190 kg (419 lbs), again despite having an appropriate and healthy-sized figure. Hair and eyes are brown. She speaks most languages of the Middle East fluently, and speaks English with a mild accent.",,,,,,,,
276,Euclid,2," SCP-276 has a variable shape, size, and mass, but always appears to be a nautical vessel of make and model relevant to whatever era it exists in. Currently, it takes the form of a large sailing schooner, 92.93 m (304.9 ft) in length and weighing 1360 metric tonnes. Under normal conditions, SCP-276 operates as a standard sailing vessel, capable of achieving 16.2 knots at optimal conditions, regardless of its current manifestation.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-276/scp276_th.jpg,,,,,,,
277,Euclid,2," SCP-277 is a moderately populated town in ¦¦¦¦, ¦¦¦¦¦. The principal anomaly within SCP-277 are apparitions found throughout the area that seem to be images projected from children’s thoughts, or imagination. These are collectively referred to as SCP-277-1. Incidents of SCP-277-1 appear as figures ‘drawn’ in white outlines, with no physical substantiality of their own.

278,Safe,1," SCP-278 is a large mechanical robot made of steel, iron, and banyan wood, strongly resembling  Idiops barkudensis , a type of Indian arachnid. Clear signs that SCP-278 has been ""upgraded"" or ""modernized"" recently have been found. Core mechanisms and frame of the body are dated back some 150 years to the [EXPUNGED] period. Many new engineering components have been added by unknown parties. Hydraulics and servos seem to have replaced what were systems of pulleys and gears driven by steam engines. The average length of SCP-278 is about 16.5 m (54 ft) from the opisthosoma (abdomen) to the tip of the furthest leg and the highest part of the main body sits about 8.2 m (27 ft) off the ground.",,,,,,,,
279,Euclid,2," SCP-279 appears to be a man in his early forties, of unremarkable appearance and dress. SCP-279 does not respond to any form of external stimuli, and has not been observed to deviate from a standard neutral expression. SCP-279 has been reported to spontaneously disappear and reappear throughout D¦¦¦, presenting unusual difficulties to agents required to monitor it.",,,,,,,,
280,Keter,3," SCP-280 is a black human-shaped mass with two large white eyes on the head and two hands with very long and thin fingers. No feet or legs are visible, as the lower portion of the body appears to fade away several centimeters from the ground. SCP-280 appears to be wholly composed of matter that can gain or lose corporeal form. This matter is very black, with only the eyes showing any other color, and when changing to a non-corporeal form, looks much like smoke.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-280/new-SCP-280.png,,,,,,,
281,Safe,1," SCP-281 is a makeshift device measuring approximately 25 cm x 35 cm x 20 cm. Built into the device is a high capacity lithium-ion laptop battery to provide power. In addition, the object incorporates a variety of components from such diverse sources as a Philips brand alarm clock, a digital kitchen timer of unknown make and model, a NEC PC-8201a portable computer and a USB keypad (brand unknown). Attempts to reverse engineer it have thus far not yielded any significant results. SCP-281 is currently not believed to be functioning as intended by its creator.",,,,,,,,
282,Safe,1," SCP-282 is a children’s toy recovered from the Truk Atoll in Micronesia. SCP-282 is in the shape of a set of devil or juggling sticks, apparently made from locally available materials. Historical/cultural sources show that SCP-282 was originally used by natives of its island of origin as part of an elaborate annual ritual (known as ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦, literally translated as “He Moves”) to bring good luck for the following year. Numerous anomalies on the island alerted the Foundation to SCP-282’s presence, including exceptionally long harvest seasons, several unknown species of fruit growing locally, and reports by missionaries of strange lights and noises, and packs of children who appeared identical. Full research on SCP-282’s properties is pending.",,,,,,,,
283,Safe,1," For all intents and purposes, SCP-283 is an ordinary rock, slightly mottled and worn from age and collisions, made of dark gray granite. It weighs just over 1 kg and is 10 cm in length. However, instead of following the usual route of gravity, SCP-283 is pulled in the direction of exact magnetic East. Close study reveals that SCP-283 is, in fact, falling around the Earth as well as being affected by its odd gravitational pull.",,,,,,,,
284,Safe,1," SCP-284-1 and SCP-284-2 are twins born ¦/¦¦/¦¦¦¦ in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, Illinois. Though they appear to be normal, they are dizygotic twins who share a single functional brain. SCP-284-1 is female, 1.72 meters tall, containing the left side of the brain. SCP-284-2 is male, 1.79 meters tall, containing the right side of the brain. The portions that are not associated with either lobe are [DATA REDACTED].",,,,,,,,
285,Euclid,2," SCP-285 is an anomalous humanoid entity with no defined shape or internal structure, the exception being SCP-285-A, which consistently manifests itself on the object's back. SCP-285's body changes sporadically, with no pattern among the alterations; despite the trauma SCP-285 incurs as a result of this bodily mutation, it will not at any point display signs of homeostatic distress. Subject claims it cannot control these changes. These changes include, but are not limited to:",,,,,,,,
286,,6," SCP-286 is a carved stone game board, measuring 83cm on a side. It bears markings consistent with the Chinese game of Liubo (??). 1  Based on artifacts found with SCP-286 during recovery, SCP-286 has been dated to at least the Shang Dynasty 2 , though all attempts to date the carvings directly have been inconclusive. Analysis of SCP-286’s composition has shown high concentrations of iron and nickel, and crystalline microstructures consistent with [REDACTED].",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-286/liubo_diagram.jpg,,,,,,,
287,Safe,1," SCP-287 is a Viking arming sword, measuring 78cm from pommel to tip and weighing 1077g. SCP-287 is in a state of significant decay due to exposure to outside elements for anywhere from 900 to 1100 years. SCP-287 was found in ¦¦¦¦¦¦, Iceland, alongside several written records. (See Discovery Log)",http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-287/287sword,,,,,,,
288,Safe,1," SCP-288 consists of a women's engagement ring (hereafter referred to as SCP-288-1) and matching men's band (hereafter referred to as SCP-288-2), both silver in appearance, the ring containing a small diamond. They are relatively plain, and bear no marks as to their origin or make, but staff routinely describe them as seeming like ""very nice wedding rings, if a little plain."" They are completely normal in every sense, and have been damaged by endurance testing (and subsequently repaired through typical jeweling practices), and their effects are only observable while worn.",http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-288/rings.jpg,,,,,,,
289,Safe,1," SCP-289 is an irregularly shaped mass of hematite (Fe 2 O 3 ), with analysis showing trace amounts of aluminum, phosphorous, [DATA EXPUNGED], and water. SCP-289 has the unique property of intensifying the effects of inertia over objects in a 1.6 m radius over time. Objects that remain immobile will become more and more difficult to move, while objects maintaining a constant speed will become very difficult to stop. At best estimate, close proximity to SCP-289 increases an object’s inertia by 17% every 160 seconds, with a slightly slower reduction of inertia over time to base levels after being removed from SCP-289’s active radius.",,,,,,,,
290,Safe,1," SCP-290 is a hollow metallic sphere 3 m in diameter, with a circular opening of diameter 90 cm cut into one side. This sphere is welded to four metal posts 50 cm in height. Scans have shown that SCP-290 is composed of a combination of aluminium and [DATA EXPUNGED], many of which do not match any known atomic structure. All attempts to take samples of the metal for more detailed analysis have failed. The external temperature of the sphere remains constant at 318 Kelvin (45 °C) regardless of the ambient conditions. As no power source for the device has been found, how it maintains this temperature is as yet unknown. Researchers have noted that personnel appear to display slightly elevated curiosity about SCP-290's function, although whether this is evidence of a psychological effect or simply due to its abnormality is not known.",,,,,,,,
291,Safe,1," SCP-291 was located in [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-291 resembles a small building in structure, a nearly featureless steel box measuring 10.5 m x 30.2 m at the base, and 15 m tall. On one of the narrow sides, there is a large door (5 m wide) that opens upwards, similar to a garage door, composed of metal slats a few inches high each. There is no handle on the exterior of the door, and while closed, all attempts to open it using non-destructive methods have failed. The interior of the door features a lock that can be opened manually to lift the door for a few seconds, before an unknown mechanism will force it shut again. At the other end of SCP-291 is a similar opening with a lock and handle on the exterior and interior, allowing the door to be opened from either side. Two small, similar hatches only 1 m x 1 m can be found to the left of both doors, and may be opened from the exterior.",,,,,,,,
292,Euclid,2," SCP-292 is a sixty-second brass hourglass, 10 cm tall. When all its sand is at the bottom and SCP-292 is flipped over, only two outcomes have ever been observed: either the sand runs out normally after one minute, or SCP-292 is knocked over on its side. (If SCP-292 is knocked over, anomalous properties do not again manifest until all the sand in SCP-292 is in one bulb.) At no time has SCP-292 ever been observed to be flipped over a second time within sixty seconds, except when knocked over as above.",,,,,,,,
293,Keter,3," SCP-293 is currently held to be some form of intangible force or presence. Questions have been raised regarding a possible intelligence behind SCP-293 in light of subject’s reactions; however, these are still unfounded. SCP-293 is most visible in its effect on human behavior, and is only detectable in very advanced cases as a very slight auditory disturbance. This lack of presence forms the major issue with SCP-293 detection, as it is almost impossible to detect if items or people are “infected” by SCP-293 without long-term observation.",,,,,,,,
294,Euclid,2," Item SCP-294 appears to be a standard coffee vending machine, the only noticeable difference being an entry touchpad with buttons corresponding to an English QWERTY keyboard. Upon depositing fifty cents US currency into the coin slot, the user is prompted to enter the name of any liquid using the touchpad. Upon doing so, a standard 12-ounce paper drinking cup is placed and the liquid indicated is poured. Ninety-seven initial test runs were performed (including requests for water, coffee, beer, and soda, non-consumable liquids such as sulfuric acid, wiper fluid, and motor oil, as well as substances that do not usually exist in liquid state, such as nitrogen, iron and glass) and each one returned a success. Test runs with solid materials such as diamond have failed, however, as it appears that SCP-294 can only deliver substances that can exist in liquid state.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-294/scp_294_by_staticfactory-d4xwn6e.jpg,,,,,,,
295,Euclid,2," SCP-295 is a number of caterpillars resembling  Syntomeida epilais  in appearance. A single specimen of SCP-295 is capable of creating an unidentifiable substance, which has several unique qualities attributed to it. SCP-295 possesses similar physical attributes to a common caterpillar, with a notable exception being SCP-295’s incredible speed when in pursuit of sustenance. When flammable material is introduced into SCP-295’s environment, it will quickly move to attempt to consume it.",,,,,,,,
296,"Primary object classification: Safe, secondary object classification: Safe/Euclid/Keter",5," Upon examination of the blast crater occupying ACS-03's previous location, a stone channel was discovered in the crater's geometric center. The stone is of an unknown composition, and was utterly unaffected by the detonations of the fail-safe devices utilized by Emergency Protocol XT-¦¦¦¦. It is unknown whether the structure designated SCP-296 existed prior to the annihilation of ACS-03's previous installations. However, the contents of SCP-296's interior suggest it was somehow created in the explosion.",,,,,,,,
297,Safe,1," SCP-297 is a transparent plastic vibrator, approximately 30 cm in length, 5 cm in width. Examination has determined that the internal structure has been heavily altered, and that the standard 6 V power supply has been converted into what appears to be a micronized nuclear reactor powered by a small quantity of plutonium.",,,,,,,,
298,Safe,1," SCP-298 is a chamber organ of indeterminate manufacture. It is believed to have been created sometime in the 1400s, in the then Holy Roman Empire. As per all pipe organs created before 1450, it has no stop controls. It is unknown if SCP-298 has possessed the unexplained physical effects from playing it for the duration of its existence, or if an unknown event altered it at some time in the past.",,,,,,,,
299,Keter,3," SCP-299 is an arboriform organism characterised by black, sharp-pointed branches. Closer inspection reveals that each instance of SCP-299 is connected to neighbouring trees by its roots. Prolonged contact converts these neighboring trees into another instance of SCP-299; this is SCP-299's only known method of reproduction.",,,,,,,,
300,Safe,1, SCP-300 consists of an antique glass perfume bottle (SCP-300-1) containing approximately 2.4 cc of an unidentified colorless liquid (SCP-300-2).,https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-300/scp300-2.png,,,,,,,
301,Euclid,2," SCP-301 is an anomalous region roughly three meters in diameter located in the middle of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ National Park. Whenever physical matter enters SCP-301, it temporarily disappears from existence. Following a delay of variable length, the matter that had entered SCP-301 will appear in another location. The duration of this time delay is variable, with a minimum length of ¦¦ seconds and a maximum length of ¦¦¦ minutes. The exact destination appears to be a random vertex point on a geodesic grid overlaying the Earth’s surface. Each leg of this pattern is approximately 20 km long, resulting in ¦¦¦¦¦¦ possible destination points.",,,,,,,,
302,,6," SCP-302 is a small tin sculpture with a bronze/patina finish depicting two ants carrying a leaf. Whenever a human makes direct skin contact with the artifact, they will invariably find a single, small, relatively harmless ant on their person within (2) hours. This ant may belong to any of several different small ant species, and its appearance rarely causes much alarm. It is of note that in all recorded cases, subjects have always distinctly noticed this first ant and fully remember seeing it.",,,,,,,,
303,Euclid,2," Witnesses describe SCP-303 as a nude, sexless, emaciated humanoid figure with reddish-brown skin. Instead of normal facial features, its head is dominated by an extremely large mouth, which bears a set of oversized human teeth. It continually vocalizes a wheezing noise, loud enough to be heard from the other side of most solid doors. All individuals who have had encounters with SCP-303 are capable of describing it in full, including individuals who have not physically seen any part of it.",,,,,,,,
304,Safe,1," SCP-304 is a radio signal at the ¦¦¦¦¦¦ GHz frequency which has been transmitting a list of names and their associated titles since its discovery in 196¦. The data within is a list of world leaders, which appears to be in chronological order. The signal begins in Morse Code with ""King William IV"" and proceeds down a list of English monarchs, American presidents and other leaders. SCP-304's format changes from Morse Code to ASCII upon reaching ""President Lyndon B Johnson"". SCP-304 lists a total of 63 persons with the title of ""President"" as well as [DATA EXPUNGED] title O5. The signal then changes from ASCII to an as-yet undeciphered format, listing an estimated 7 more names. After the 7th undeciphered name, SCP-304 pauses for 12 seconds and repeats. The reason for the abrupt conclusion of the list is unknown.",,,,,,,,
305,Euclid,2," SCP-305 is a rock formation of approximately humanoid size and shape. Remote recordings of SCP-305 show that it remains stationary at all times, even when interacting with human subjects.",,,,,,,,
,,6," SCP-306 is a fungus related to the genus  Trichophyton . SCP-306 can infect humans through inhalation of spores or by skin to skin contact. Initial symptoms of infection can include coughing and sneezing, and skin lesions. Lesions caused by SCP-306 display a morphology similar to benign papillomas (warts), and reach full size after approximately two (2) days. Lesions are prone to shedding, after which another lesion forms underneath. Lesions that fall from the body of infected subjects are light enough to be carried by wind, and capable of spreading SCP-306 for years. If untreated, lesions caused by SCP-306 can cover the body within two (2) weeks.  SCP-306 appears to mainly infect humans; however, testing is ongoing to determine any additional carriers.  SCP-306 has been shown to grow in nearly all biological matter.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-306/toad.jpg,,,,,,,
307,Keter,3," SCP-307 is a creeping vine, similar in appearance to the common English ivy  (Hedera helix) , save for the presence of greenish thorns on the stems, and the tendency of the leaves to exhibit a purple hue. The vine puts down roots approximately every 30.5 cm (12 in). The roots can penetrate any porous material, but not metal. Any part of the plant not connected to a root system is to be considered dead and safe to examine up close.",,,,,,,,
,Safe,1," SCP-308 is an ornate funerary casing of Aztec origin, dated ~500 years old with dimensions 1.8 m x 0.9 m x 1.2 m. It was found at the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ archaeological excavation among similar (though mundane) artifacts in a temple complex. SCP-308 is covered in Nahuatl pictographs consistent with ceremonial practices of its time, though unusual in the care and expense devoted to them. Under normal conditions the artifact is inert, but it exerts an animating effect on organisms when they are placed inside it. The effect was first observed in the original inhabitant of the coffin, [DATA EXPUNGED] The poor condition of the individual has been attributed to its 500 year incarceration in the casing without nourishment or stimulation.",,,,,,,,
309,Euclid,2," SCP-309 is a small, plush stuffed animal that looks as if it has been turned completely inside out. Golden-orange fur is present along the seams, while a small amount of cotton stuffing and two protruding eyes are visible on the head. The interior of SCP-309 is understuffed with cotton, giving it a flexible and cuddly feel.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-309/stuffedanimal.jpg,,,,,,,
310,Safe,1," SCP-310 is a 157 mm tall white candle, composed of apparently standard tallow. SCP-310 is an unmarked 33 mm diameter cylinder with tapered tip, out of which emerges 7 mm of wick. When not immersed in an oxygen-free medium, the wick produces a steady 24 mm tall flame. This flame can be extinguished through most conventional means: removal of oxygen, immersion in non-flammable fluid, application of sudden intense airflow. However, on the removal of the inhibiting factor, the flame immediately reappears, behaving much like a standard ""trick candle"".",,,,,,,,
,,5,,,,,,,,,
312,Euclid,2," SCP-312 is an organism composed of very thin tissue layers and filled with atmospheric gases at a slightly higher temperature than the surrounding air. It typically floats approximately ¦¦¦ meters above the ground, although it will vary this in order to maintain its position relative to prey.",http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-312/yoric,,,,,,,
313,Safe,1," SCP-313 is identical in appearance and marking to a World Dryer Corp Model A electric hand dryer. The object measures 25 cm x 24 cm x 21 cm. Its casing is painted white steel, with a polished stainless steel nozzle and button. Internal workings are consistent with Model A specifications. However, despite this veneer of normalcy, SCP-313 has two significantly anomalous qualities – first and foremost, it is utterly indestructible and impervious to all forces available to us, and secondly, it is extraordinarily destructive, apparently by design. Destruction test logs are available on request to those with level 2 or higher security clearance.",,,,,,,,
314,Euclid,2," SCP-314 is a 0.97 m long, 0.21 m thick obelisk which is highly reflective and metallic in appearance, with tapered edges that are apparently sharpened to a molecular level. No material has ever been recovered from SCP-314.",,,,,,,,
315,Safe,1," Object consists of a set of ninety-five (95) standard 8.5 GB recordable DVD-format discs, arranged in a stack on a black plastic spindle. Examination of the label side of each disc reveals no manufacturer's name. Printed into each matte label is the title ""PoC 1/1"". Beneath this, each disc carries a unique symbol or glyph. No two discs carry the same symbol.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-315/scp-315.jpg,,,,,,,
316,Safe,1," SCP-316 is a bronze, aged carbide lamp. The casing corresponds to no manufactured models and appears to be homemade. The bulb is ordinary, and can be replaced without impeding the function of SCP-316. Internal circuitry of SCP-316 is constructed of an unknown metal, rather than copper. The casing has a battery compartment which takes two D batteries.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-316/SCP-316.jpg,,,,,,,
317,Safe,1," SCP-317-1 is the cadaver of a sapient reptilian entity tentatively identified as a previously-unknown species of pachycephalosaurid. Subject was bipedal, female, and 3 m tall, and wore clothing made from synthetic polymers; subject also wore corrective lenses. Subject was largely herbivorous, and had prehensile digits.",,,,,,,,
318,Safe,1," SCP-318 appears similar to a small version of a crude rotary printing press, with a great deal of additional machinery attached at various locations. The device is composed primarily of a variety of hardwoods, with metallic parts made from brass, bronze, cast or wrought iron, copper, steel, and aluminum. SCP-318 in its entirety is approximately 3.5 m wide, 6 m long, and 2 m tall. A more complete physical description can be found in Addendum 318-02.",,,,,,,,
319,Keter,3," SCP-319 is a mechanical device constructed circa 1894, consisting primarily of 12 interlocking rings assembled in an 8-meter diameter spherical formation, allowing a clockwork mechanism, driven by electric motors, to rotate each ring separately on each axis. The purpose of the assembly appears to be the precise placement of 12 instances of SCP-319-1 in relation to each other. The assembly has been frozen in its current configuration since its recovery, and current motion of instances of SCP-319-1 have been almost solely due to tectonic disturbances and thermal expansion/contraction of the material comprising SCP-319. 1",,,,,,,,
320,Euclid,2, SCP-320 is a small glass sphere which affects normal Euclidean space when accelerated along any line of motion. The ball of glass itself is just over 10.4 cm (4.1 in) in diameter and just 31.2 grams (1.1 ounces). Light refraction experiments and computed tomography scans have proven that SCP-320 does contain a hollow vacuum. No physical tests have been able to explain why SCP-320 reacts with space/time in the manner that it does.,,,,,,,,
321,Safe,1," SCP-321 is a human female, born on July 4, 18¦¦. SCP-321 is currently 3.1 meters tall, and weighs approximately 110 kilograms. Subject is devoid of melanins in hair, eyes, and skin. It is incapable of speech, but can still vocalise, and has proven to have problems with spacial recognition and awareness. SCP-321 has displayed a low degree of intellect, and has problems adjusting to new situations.",,,,,,,,
322,Safe,1," SCP-322 is a cardboard box, 60 cm (24 in) in width, 30 cm (12 in) in height, and 15 cm (6 in) in depth, with the words "" Grow Your Own Castle Kit "" and a stylized cartoon similar to those in circulation in the 1950's.",,,,,,,,
323,Euclid,2," SCP-323 is the skull of an unidentified cervid measuring 55cm long, 27cm wide, and 31cm tall, with a pair of antlers, measuring 35cm tall and 46cm from tip to tip, growing from the left and right sides of SCP-323. SCP-323 shows signs of damage consistent with outside exposure, with regular pitting, scarring and weathering across the object, bleaching on the upper surfaces and a missing lower mandible. The rear of the skull features an approximately centered ovoid gap, measuring 25 cm high and 23cm wide, giving access to an interior space 16cm deep. This gap shows signs of tool use, indicating that it was carved with tools, possibly stone.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-323/uhhDc.png,,,,,,,
324,Safe,1," SCP-324 is a small, evergreen shrub currently 1.4 meters in height and possessing a complex root system that extends approximately 2.5m below the soil. Leaves are lanceolate, ranging between 4-6cm in width. During the flowering phase, SCP-324 produces small (14-22mm) white flowers with nine (9) petals. Berries produced by SCP-324 are designated SCP-324-1, and appear pinkish-white in color with diameters between nine (9) and fourteen (14) millimeters. Berries are edible, with flavor reported as tart and mildly sweet.",,,,,,,,
325,Safe,1," SCP-325 is a small bottle of ¦¦¦¦¦¦ brand washing detergent, a product commonly sold in the United Kingdom. However, the ""¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦!"" name present on the label does not match any of the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ company's current products. SCP-325 contains a semi-viscous green liquid, identical in chemical composition to the ""Naturals"" range of washing detergent sold by ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦. SCP-325 is a ""Value pack"" container of concentrated detergent, and currently contains 1,775 millilitres of fluid. One (1) wash of SCP-325 requires 25 ml of liquid, as indicated on the instructions located on the rear of the bottle. This information also contains a warning detailing [REDACTED].",,,,,,,,
326,Euclid,2," SCP-326 is a human female, approximately 65-70 years old, 1  who has been subjected to significant body modifications by an anomalous technology. When inactive, these modifications are detectable only by subject's anomalous mass (230 kg, despite a physique which would indicate a mass of at most 45 kg), and by the presence of significant keloid scarring along her arms, legs, hands, feet, and spinal column. When subject becomes agitated, the scars rupture lengthwise, and the components of a structure emerge; this structure resembles an exoskeleton made from human bone, and bestows upon SCP-326 enhanced strength and speed. The degree to which her speed and strength are enhanced is unknown, as she is reluctant to participate in quantitative testing; however, she has demonstrated the ability to (when in a panic) throw two 100-kilogram security guards over distances greater than 4 meters, and to travel over 20 meters to her panic room in 2.8 seconds. Due to logistical difficulties with sampling (not only is the exoskeleton extremely durable, its accessibility is limited to those times when SCP-326 is panic-stricken), the physical composition of the exoskeleton is as yet unknown, as is its connectivity to SCP-326's musculature and nervous system. Radiographic imaging has been hindered by the subject's phobic reaction to X-ray machines.",,,,,,,,
,Euclid,2," SCP-327 is a female specimen of a mammalian species resembling members of the order  Sirenia , specifically  Trichechus manatus  (West Indian manatee), measuring approximately 2.8 m in length and 450 kg in weight, and estimated to be between 25 and 30 years of age. The subject bears anomalous bodily features: The flippers bear distinct fingers and a functioning opposable thumb, and the skull and facial features resemble that of a human. SCP-327 was hit by a boat propeller 5-10 years before retrieval, as evidenced by heavy scarring on the head and back and traces of severe head trauma.",,,,,,,,
328,Safe,1," SCP-328 is a smooth, greenish-yellow disc approximately ten (10) cm in diameter and 4 mm thick, weighing just over thirteen (13) grams, composed of an unknown crystalline organic compound.

SCP-328-01 (see below), a data file retrieved from SCP-328, seems to confirm this.",,,,,,,,
329,Euclid,2," SCP-329 is a room in a derelict building at ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦. Room is in the building's cellar, 6m x 5m, with a steel fire door. Room contains six folding beds. Beds are fitted with IV stands and leather restraints.",,,,,,,,
330,Safe,1," SCP-330 appears to be a small round stainless steel bowl filled with a variable amount of individually wrapped pieces of candy. Taped to the side of the bowl is a handwritten note, reading “take no more than two, please!!” Attempts to remove the note have met with failure, as have attempts to hide or obscure it. Testers have noted finding it impossible to avoid reading the note, and those who approach it from an opposite angle are aware of this request.",,,,,,,,
331,Safe,1," SCP-331 is a red plastic cat collar, approximately 23 cm in length. Metal studs surround the collar in intervals of 1 cm; testing has confirmed the metal to be nickel. The bell consists of stainless steel electroplated with 24-carat gold. Ringing the bell has no distinguishable effect, adverse or otherwise. The word “Tumbles” has been painted on the back of the collar in yellow paint; testing has confirmed that there is nothing unusual about the paint.",,,,,,,,
332,Safe,1," SCP-332 is the Kirk Lonwood High School Marching Band of the Fall 1975 season. The band is composed of thirty members, which are designated as SCP-332-1 through SCP-332-30. All members of SCP-332 were formerly enrolled as seniors at Kirk Lonwood High School, and expected to graduate in Spring 1976.

333,Euclid,2," SCP-333-A are 1,618 identical copies of a musical score of unknown title and origin. When the score denoted by SCP-333-A is performed by an orchestra of sufficient size, (see  Addendum 333-1 ) SCP-333-B manifests. The chamber SCP-333-A is performed in may be entered normally; however, roughly three minutes into a performance, anything leaving the chamber arrives in SCP-333-B. Reentry of the performance hall from SCP-333-B is possible, given it is temporarily integrated into SCP-333-B.",,,,,,,,
334,Euclid,2," SCP-334 is a small cloud of superheated plasma in the shape of a specimen most closely resembling  Vulpes vulpes , or the common red fox. Its body appears similar to waves of steam or fire, revealing gaps between the filaments of gas through which the opposite side is visible. Its filaments fluoresce in the spectrum of red and orange, with 'eyes' in the blue spectrum. Subject has a negligible measurable mass, and has no central body to speak of. SCP-334 apparently believes it is actually a red fox, and displays several normal vulpine behaviors, such as hunting of prey, and in test 334F-03 [REDACTED]. Whether it is an entity that imprinted on a vulpine or is a vulpine which was transformed to its current state is unknown and under investigation.",,,,,,,,
335,Safe,1," SCP-335 is a set of one hundred and fifty 3.5"" floppy disks discovered in a cardboard box found in the attic of former Agent ¦¦¦ shortly after her termination. Each disk is individually numbered in hand-written permanent marker. Disks are to be referred to by their number; SCP-335-001, SCP-335-002, etc. Each disk has also been labeled with a human name in the same writing as the numbering. 118 are male names and 30 are female. There is some speculation as to whether SCP-335-011 ""Jackie"" is meant to be male or female. The names have no identified pattern.",,,,,,,,
336,Euclid,2," SCP-336 appears to be a pale-skinned human female of otherwise Arabic or Middle-Eastern descent in its late twenties. SCP-336 is 1.73m (5ft,8in) in height and weighs 68kg (150lbs) as of its last physical. Subject requires no sleep or sustenance, and does not appear to be affected by aging or sickness of any nature. The object is anatomically human with the exception of dermal irregularities along the thighs and calves, which appear structurally similar to reptilian scales.",,,,,,,,
337,Euclid,2," SCP-337 is a large conglomeration of human hair weighing approximately 60 kg at last measure. The object’s shape and dimensions are tremendously variable. SCP-337 is fully animate, capable of a wide range of locomotion, and can exert force in excess of 18 kN. It also seems to possess some level of sentience, although attempts at communication have thus far met with limited success (see Incident 337-B).",,,,,,,,
338,Safe,1," SCP-338 is a portable crank- and battery-powered survival radio manufactured by ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, Inc. Disassembly reveals no anomalies compared to similar radios, with the exception of 3 small (~1 mm in diameter) drops of solder on the receiver circuitry. Replicating this defect on other models does not result in effects similar to SCP-338. Excepting the anomalous properties described below, SCP-338 functions identically to similar models manufactured by ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, Inc.",,,,,,,,
339,Keter,3," SCP-339 is a group of tendrils extending off a central mass. It is approximately 50 cm from tip-to-tip, although this is variable. It appears to be made out of weathered copper, but shows a much higher level of durability and independent mobility. The individual tendrils constantly move as though underwater, continually grinding on the sides of any containment, silently pulverizing it at a gradual but constant rate. Because of this, the sound-proofed box it is currently contained in must be replaced at regular intervals.",,,,,,,,
340,Safe,1," SCP-340 is produced by a human-specific virus which preferentially colonizes the nasal cavities. The virus cannot be identified according to the Baltimore classification scheme, leading Foundation researchers to believe it was engineered by parties as-yet unidentified. The presence of genes from both HIV and the SARS coronavirus supports this hypothesis.",,,,,,,,
341,Safe,1," A collection of eleven brass and iron orreries found in a large storage room of a basement at Oxford comprise SCP-341. Each orrery is a rough scale model of a different extra-solar star system, complete with planets, moons and one or more suns in the center. A unique clockwork mechanism under each orrery allows the brass models of planets and moons to spin on axis and rotate around each model of its parent star(s). Testing dates each machine to be between 150-200 years old, but without any specific markings, researchers have been unable to determine who created them.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-341/341-4.jpg,,,,,,,
342,Euclid,2," SCP-342 normally takes the form of a mass transit ticket for the closest form of mass transportation to its current location. At the moment, it takes the form of a train ticket, departing from ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ Station. When held by a sentient person for any length of time, it will eventually change form into a transit ticket for a form of transportation its holder desires to use. This transformation always takes place when not being directly or indirectly observed: no recordings of SCP-342 changing form exist at this time. SCP-342 is indistinguishable from any valid transit ticket and may be used as such.",,,,,,,,
343,Safe,1," SCP-343 is a male, seemingly race-less, humanoid in appearance with apparent omnipotence. SCP-343 was discovered walking the streets of Prague and detained after a staff member witnessed him disappear from the streets and reappear on a rooftop. SCP-343 is detained willingly in his chamber, as containment has proved impossible (see notes).",,,,,,,,
344,Safe,1," SCP-344 is a ¦¦¦¦-brand manual can opener manufactured some time before 19¦¦. When an attempt is made to use SCP-344 to open a tin of canned food, there is a probability that, as soon as the top of the can is fully opened, the food inside will be replaced with live versions of whatever the can originally contained. The amount of live material released is equal to how many separate individuals of that given species were required to produce the contents of the can, provided the weight of an individual's remains is above 0.¦¦ mg. For example, if a can of tuna has the remains of fifty tuna in it, then fifty live tuna will come out of the can. Compressing items like this into a small space causes significant pressure, resulting in the objects being propelled out with some force, potentially causing injury to anyone within the area of effect. Live organisms in a can that is opened by SCP-344 undergo no observable changes.",,,,,,,,
345,Safe,1," SCP-345 is a stone cube, whose faces are each divided into nine squares of equal size, and sections of which can be rotated in a fashion similar to a common puzzle toy. Each face of the cube measures 5.7 cm. Instead of the normal six colors commonly found in this kind of puzzle, the squares represent six different materials: an intrusive magmatic rock resembling granite, an intrusive magmatic rock resembling gabbro, an extrusive magmatic rock resembling basalt, a sedimentary rock resembling sandstone, volcanic glass resembling obsidian, and a high-grade metamorphic rock resembling granite gneiss.",,,,,,,,
346,Safe,1," SCP-346 is a small member of an unidentified family of pterodactyl- ancient flying reptiles. SCP-346 is approximately the size of a small bat, and has very lightweight bone structure. Although its head, wings, and legs are bare, its main body is covered with a soft coat of fur-like, dark colored down. The origin of SCP-346 is unknown, and was purchased by Agent ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ in a small pet shop in Brazil, being marketed under the name ""Kongo-mato"".",,,,,,,,
347,"Euclid (With proper counseling, SCP-347 may be considered safe eventually)",5," SCP-347 is an adult/young adult female, standing at 164cm tall, and 55kg in weight. Despite being a seemingly average woman between the age of 19 and 25, SCP-347 is completely invisible. This also includes everything inside her body at any given moment, although her waste products and saliva appear once they lose contact with her, but her blood, skin, and hair samples all remain invisible. Testing has confirmed that she has normal eyesight, despite the fact that the cones and rods of the eyes must be visible in order for a human to see. SCP-347 describes herself as being an average female of mixed race, with brown eyes and wavy black hair, and refers to herself as Claudia, although it is highly likely that this is a false name taken from the actor Claude Rains, the lead of  The Invisible Man . Her true identity has not been ascertained.",,,,,,,,
348,Safe,1," SCP-348 is a white ceramic bowl patterned with light blue flowers, measuring approximately 20 cm in diameter and 9 cm high. While no maker’s marks are present, the Chinese characters for “thinking of you” (???, “ xiang zhe ni ”) are etched into the side of the bowl.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-348/348.jpg,,,,,,,
,Safe,1," The artifact designated SCP-349-01 is a large granite tombstone, approximately 400 years old. The primary inscription reads ""Nicolas Flamel"", followed by the dates ""1376-1606"". Underneath these inscriptions, there lies the legend  ""you have failed""  in large, capital letters. The tombstone is damaged and partially eroded, with several large cracks evident across its face. It was reported by Agent ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, an amateur genealogist in cemetery plot near Bath, England on ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦.",,,,,,,,
350,Safe,1," SCP-350 appears to be a single page contract followed by 49 blank sheets. The contract outlines a basic exchange of a good or service in exchange for a small amount of money wired to a numbered account at ¦¦¦¦¦¦ Bank in Zurich, Switzerland. The wording of SCP-350 is different to every reader prior to signature, and the good or service offered is always something the subject has expressed great desire to obtain. The document is also always in the native language of the reader, and conforms to the laws of the nation in which the subject makes their primary residence. Attempts to use video or photography to get an objective image of SCP-350 at this stage have failed, as the text continues to vary from person to person.",,,,,,,,
,,6," SCP-351 is an ASCII plaintext (.txt) file containing a virulent memetic agent, which implants false memories visualized as ASCII art 1  into human subjects that view the file. The primary component of the anomaly is SCP-351-1, a string of 30 characters which does not correspond to characters in any known encoding standard, which converts the entire file into a memetic vector.",,,,,,,,
352,Keter,3," SCP-352 appears to be a very old, emaciated woman of indeterminate age and race. SCP-352 speaks Old Russian, but with an accent and dialect that makes translation very difficult. SCP-352 is extremely unwilling to communicate, with most of the conversations thus far made primarily of threats or statements of revenge. SCP-352 has never identified herself by any name, and due to her aggressive nature, it has been impossible to determine any background information.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-352/352/medium.jpg,,,,,,,
353,Keter,3," SCP-353 appears to be a normal human female, twenty-six years old, of average physical capacity and average intelligence. Subject has the capacity to siphon infectious viral and bacterial agents from her environment, nurture and store them within her body, and then redistribute them to devastating pandemic effect. SCP-353’s mood directly affects the radius of infections recorded, with increased emotional states leading to massively increased potency.",,,,,,,,
354,Keter,3," SCP-354 is a pool of red liquid discovered in northern Canada. The liquid is of a consistency similar to that of human blood (hence the colloquial name Blood Pond) but is not of a biological nature. The pool does not have definite banks; soil mixes with the liquid until, at a certain point, there is more soil than liquid and the ground is mostly solid. The liquid becomes denser as one descends deeper into the pool; if the pool has a bottom, it has yet to be reached.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-354/redpool-new.jpg,,,,,,,
355,Euclid,2," SCP-355 is an unknown species indistinguishable to the naked eye from ordinary grass, but its nearest known genetic relation is the mahogany taxon. A hollow core of cellulose and buckminsterfullerene runs through the center of each blade to maintain the grass' vertical structure, and each vein in the leaf is sheathed in a similar core, resulting in an unusually inflexible grass, sharp enough on the outside to pierce light wood and some plastics. The main blade performs photosynthesis and absorbs atmospheric nutrients as usual. Root structure is unusually deep for a short plant, but otherwise normal.",,,,,,,,
356,Neutralized,0," SCP-356 is a deceased 62-year-old male human of Eurasian descent, measuring 1.76 m tall and weighing 81.5 kg. When SCP-356 is within approximately 3 m of any device capable of receiving a telephone call (such as traditional land-based telephones, cellular phones, or computer terminals with software enabling telephony), that device will begin receiving a constant stream of calls. Left unanswered, these calls will continue for an indefinite period, only ceasing when answered, and resuming once the speaker hangs up. In all observed cases, attempts to track the source of telephone calls related to the presence of SCP-356 have all identified the device receiving the calls itself as the origination point.",,,,,,,,
357,,6," SCP-357 is a malleable substance with a density of 250 kg/m 3 . The material has been found to reflect all radiation with 100% efficiency. To date, chemical analysis of SCP-357 has yielded no conclusive results. Electron microscopy of SCP-357 has shown no inherent granularity at any level. These two latter results suggest that SCP-357 may not be atomic in nature; however, there have been no satisfactory hypotheses as to how baryonic matter is able to interact with it.",,,,,,,,
358,Euclid,2," SCP-358 is an abandoned trauma center located on the outskirts of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, England. The grounds surrounding the building are overgrown with vegetation native to the area and characteristic of extreme neglect. The building's exterior is weathered but otherwise intact, with windows and entrances boarded up to prevent trespassing and vandalism. Air inside is arid, measured on average at 45 degrees Celsius, with hotter dry gusts of air that blow through the hallways from no discernible source. Exploration and monitoring has revealed anomalous activity characteristic of typical type three pseudospiritual manifestation (haunting) ranging from glowing spheres to full bodied apparitions, all of which appear exhausted and on occasion ask for water. Recognizable apparitions appear to be individuals who have been exposed to SCP-358 beyond the average (47 minute) psychological recoverability point in the past. The majority of these subjects reside in Foundation psychological observational facilities, and security footage shows them present in their respective units during the appearance of their apparitions within SCP-358.",,,,,,,,
,,6,,http://lspr.wdfiles.com/local--files/toprewrite/perch.jpg,,,,,,,
360,Euclid,2," SCP-360 is an anomalous ritual that ostensibly allows a single living human subject to ascend to a higher plane of existence. When performed at an altitude of 10,500 meters or higher, affected subjects emit a blinding light and a burst of high-energy radiation for several seconds, then disappear. The radiation dosage is negligible and does not pose any long-term danger to affected individuals; however, due to the altitude required for successful activation, SCP-360 has resulted in numerous aviation incidents involving both public and private aircraft.",,,,,,,,
361,Safe,1," SCP-361 is a bronze Etruscan artifact, in the shape of a sheep's liver. SCP-361 is covered in the names of Etruscan gods and instructions for various religious rites, and is believed to have served as a tool for practicing haruspicy- divination using animal organs. SCP-361 bears a strong resemblance to the non-anomalous artifact known as the Liver of Piacenza, with which it was originally found during the late 19th century. Both artifacts date to the 2nd-3rd century BCE, to the province of Piacenza, Italy.",,,,,,,,
362,Safe,1," SCP-362 is a light blue T-shirt bearing the logo of [REDACTED], a children’s “Saturday morning cartoon” television program popular in the late 1980s and early 90s. It is a size M (medium), with short sleeves. Its color appears to have faded, and was likely a darker shade of blue. Its tag states the T-shirt is made of 100% cotton; testing has confirmed this statement. Despite its apparent age, it is in good condition apart from said fading: its collar and sleeves are not worn or threadbare and it has no holes or rips.",,,,,,,,
363,Keter,3," Ostensibly, SCP-363 are identical to  Scolopendra gigantea , or the Amazonian giant centipede. Dietary needs are identical, and DNA inspection has proven no dissimilarities to normal  S. gigantea .",,,,,,,,
364,Safe,1," SCP-364 is a point several hundred meters above the volcano Surt on Io, the innermost of Jupiter’s Galilean satellites. At irregular intervals, varying amounts of material (up to 4000 cubic meters at a time) spontaneously appear at this location and settle into Surt, where the material is incinerated by the lava flow from the volcano. The mechanism by which this material appears is not known, and no permanent physical structure has as yet been detected near SCP-364, at any other location on Io, or anywhere else in the Jovian system. In addition, no unusual energy emissions have been detected coming from SCP-364 or the surrounding area.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-364/scp-364.jpg,,,,,,,
365,Euclid,2," SCP-365 is a green pool noodle made of polyethylene foam. By itself, it displays no unusual properties and is physically identical to a typical noodle of similar size. SCP-365's unusual properties manifest only when it is placed in a body of water. When a subject completely submerges in said body of water, they become unable to get out.",,,,,,,,
366,Euclid,2," SCP-366 refers to a human endoparasite of unknown,  possibly extraterrestrial  origin that starts its lifecycle in an ovum stage. In male hosts, ova can develop into a larval stage. In female hosts, larval stage specimens may transition to the adult stage. Larvae introduced to male hosts and ova introduced to female hosts live at most three hours before expiring due to a lack of the hormones necessary for their further development. Attempts to cultivate infestations in other organisms have not yielded any results, with SCP-366 specimens of any stage expiring as expected when outside a human host.",,,,,,,,
367,Euclid,2," SCP-367 appears to be a small dog of variable breed, most often appearing as a small, brown puppy. SCP-367 exhibits a slightly elevated appetite and activity level for a dog of its apparent age and size, and does not sleep, but otherwise behaves as expected for a dog.",,,,,,,,
368,,0," SCP-368 is an animated origami crane folded from ornate, heavy-stock paper. Left to its own devices, it will perch, preen, fly from platform to platform, groom, and occasionally construct a makeshift nest out of nearby office supplies. It responds to human touch affectionately, much as a domesticated bird would. The item's demeanor is, on the whole, friendly, and it has been observed to perch on the shoulders of various SCP personnel. Though the item needs no source of nourishment, it appears to ""sleep"" at night in that it places its head under its wing. Studying the physical properties of SCP-368 has proven difficult: the item seems to interpret attempts to capture or contain it as a game and has displayed considerable agility and resourcefulness in evading even the most focused attempts at containment. How SCP-368 stays airborne and maintains its stability while airborne are still not known.",,,,,,,,
369,Euclid,2," SCP-369 is a migratory road construction zone which repairs stretches of road left untended by repair crews. It generates nonfunctional look-alikes of several essential road construction vehicles, of note being a small steam-roller and an earth mover, the latter being anything from a bobcat to a backhoe. The traffic cones present at the border of the effect are actual traffic cones, lacking any serial number or manufacturer’s mark, and always appear to have been in use for at least a few years. If removed from the site, the cones vanish when unobserved. The machines cannot be used or maintained, and testing has shown it unwise to try.",,,,,,,,
370,Keter,3," SCP-370 is a key. The size, shape, material and general appearance of SCP-370 are unknown. Knowledge of these characteristics is the primary vector for the spread of the SCP-370 disease, therefore all records thought to contain such information have been destroyed without review.",,,,,,,,
371,Euclid,2," SCP-371 is a macroscopic marine virus, similar in appearance to a bacteriophage. SCP-371 specimens range in size from between 20 centimeters to 2.5 meters, are somewhat transparent, and can be mistaken for jellyfish in water.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-371/phage.png,,,,,,,

373,Safe,1," SCP-373 is an antique disc phonograph player. Markings on the machine indicate it was built in 191¦; an additional label indicates that the device was modified in late 194¦ at a facility called ""¦¦¦¦¦ Laboratories, Inc."" The device is composed of a crank-operated turntable embedded in a wooden case, a tone arm with an aluminum stylus, and a slightly tarnished silver horn.",,,,,,,,
374,Safe,1, SCP-374 is a French Revolution-era guillotine made of oak with a steel blade. SCP-374 manifests no unusual properties when not in use. Any use of SCP-374 to decapitate a live human produces an instance of SCP-374-1.,,,,,,,,
375,Euclid,2," SCP-375 is a former Wells Fargo bank located in Casper, Wyoming. The signage on the building and front door has been anomalously modified to read “Temporal Credit Union” while retaining the original Wells Fargo typeface. A series of eleven humanoid entities (designated SCP-375-A) remain present within the building at all times, equipped in matching uniforms and claiming to be employees of SCP-375.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-375/scp375.jpg,,,,,,,
376,Safe,1," SCP-376 appears to be an irregular traffic light with an excessive amount of components attached, resembling more of a tree than a standard traffic light. However, SCP-376 is not a man-made object, but is in fact a naturally occurring organism. It is currently unknown how or why SCP-376 has managed to mimic the appearance of a traffic light.",,,,,,,,
377,Safe,1, SCP-377 is a box of La Choy brand fortune cookies. The box was full when it was recovered from [DATA EXPUNGED] and has since restocked itself regularly every 12 hours.,,,,,,,,
378,Thaumiel,4," SCP-378 is an arthropod superficially resembling a deformed larval instance of  Scolopendra gigantea 3 . SCP-378's legs are largely vestigial, primarily meant to assist in peristaltic locomotion. SCP-378 measures 3 meters from mouth to anus, with a bodily thickness of 1 meter and a weight of 233 kilograms. Under normal conditions, SCP-378 is an omnivore, with a diet consisting primarily of lichen and insects.",,,,,,,,
379,Safe,1," SCP-379 is a translucent, pale, silver liquid contained in a small crystal bottle. The bottle is topped with an atomizer cap which delivers approximately one-half (.5) ml of the clear substance inside the bottle.",,,,,,,,
380,Safe,1," SCP-380 is a small, blue box with an appearance not unlike an internet router. It has a single antenna, a few lights, a power switch and a single T3-line female connector. Although there is no plug for an outside source of electricity, SCP-380 will work when it is connected to a network-capable computer and the 'power' switch in the on position.",,,,,,,,
381,Safe,1," SCP-381 comprises 7 unbound pages of yellowing paper sheet music. Chemical analysis has confirmed that the ink on the paper is made of a mix of a solution of tannic acids with ferrous sulphate and gum, consistent with a recipe for ink contemporary with the paper’s estimated year of production (15¦¦ CE).",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-381/SCP381.jpg,,,,,,,
382,Euclid,2," In its inactive state, SCP-382-1 is a large baby carriage, manufactured in 19¦¦ by ¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ & ¦¦¦¦¦¦ of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, England. Its age shows; metal components are heavily rusted, the rubber of the tires is brittle, and the cushion is missing.",,,,,,,,
383,Euclid,2," SCP-383 is a viral infection, first categorized as a variant of influenza. The initial symptoms of SCP-383 are similar to those of the common cold, ranging through a variety of aches and pains, sinus issues, sore throat, upset stomach, coughing and sneezing, and fatigue. It appears to only be capable of infecting human hosts, but has been observed to be carried by other animals, such as rats and pigeons. Similar to a common infection, SCP-383 will work its way through the human body naturally within a few days, or faster with routine antivirals.",,,,,,,,
384,Safe,1," SCP-384 is currently the access door to Containment Unit-077. SCP-384 has a variable form; any door installed in the same building as it can spontaneously take on its properties. This transfer will also occur if SCP-384 is destroyed. When recovered from a raid on a Marshall, Carter, and Dark Ltd. auction, SCP-384 had been contained in a similar manner, with it isolated in a separate building with only one available door for it to inhabit.",,,,,,,,
385,Safe,1," SCP-385 is a waist-mounted harness crafted from heavily antiqued leather and brass. A curled electrical cord connects a hand-held push button switch to the mechanism mounted on the front of the harness, which itself contains a superfluous set of interlocking gears and colored LED light bulbs. The harness has sustained significant impact damage. A damaged engraving on the front of the mechanism reads ""Special Edition! 3 of [ILLEGIBLE]"" and ""[ILLEGIBLE] by The Factory.""",,,,,,,,
386,Euclid,2," SCP-386 is a form of mushroom that appears to have highly regenerative processes, and is highly resistant to physical damage. Single units of SCP-386 grow from individual microscopic spores. These spores grow and reach maturity within four days. Spores have been observed to grow without water, sunlight, or any form of nutrients, and can remain viable even after exposure to high heat, vacuum, radiation, and extreme kinetic force. SCP-386 produces no hyphae, and the means by which it gathers the energy for growth is unknown. A mild acid (pH 4) appears to be secreted in small quantities by the cap, identification of which has been inconclusive.",,,,,,,,
387,Safe,1," SCP-387 is a tub of commercially available Lego, normal in design. Irregular shapes not featured in normal sets, such as circular “wheels,” and prisms, are also available. It has no brand name, and every company interviewed by undercover Agents thus far has denied ever making irregular Lego. When the tub is not full (i.e. when it is partially or almost-fully emptied) the Lego will slowly duplicate themselves, stopping when the container is full.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-387/legopile.jpg,,,,,,,
388,Euclid,2," SCP-388 consists of a foldable nylon frisbee of the type commonly given away as promotional material, in this case bearing the logo of the Banana Boat Suntan Lotion corporation. SCP-388 appears to be immune to damage; during testing, it has been able to withstand high caliber rifle shots, immersion in high acidity baths, and sustained temperatures of 3500 °C. In all cases, it would spring back, unharmed, to its original shape. X-ray crystallography reveals the molecular structure of SCP-388 to be completely normal nylon supported by a ring of metal appearing to be aluminum.",,,,,,,,
389,Safe,1," SCP-389 is a green glass bottle, approximately 45 cm in length. There are no markings or other distinguishing features on it.",,,,,,,,
390,Safe,1," SCP-390 is the remains of a large mechanical device that is suggested to have been approximately 6 m in height and 4 m in diameter, hand-crafted and primarily composed of wood, rubber, and other organic materials with metal fixtures and fittings. The remaining, intact section of the device consists of a large aiming mechanism topped with a heavy, sealed housing containing multiple large glass lenses as well as several components that have yet to be identified. Despite carbon dating of the wood in the structure placing the device at approximately 2200-2300 years old, little to no deterioration of the device's non-wooden components has occurred.",,,,,,,,
391,Safe,1," SCP-391 is a single female specimen of  Tyto alba alba , or common barn owl. Pellets regurgitated by SCP-391 are typically comprised of some form of precious metal. The metal produced seems to vary with the type of prey ingested. The owl, nicknamed Midas, has been documented regurgitating gold, silver, platinum, and other precious metals. Refer to the SCP-391 Test Logs for more information.",,,,,,,,
392,Safe,1," SCP-392 is an artificial plant species created via Daevite thaumaturgy, 1  resembling the species  Prunus persica  (peach). According to  A Chronicle of the Daevas , creation of SCP-392 was attributed to Daevite Matriarch Waq of the Waq clan c. 800 BCE. While originally perceived as an act of social deviance in Daevite society, cultivation was tolerated 2  and adopted by matrilineal descendants of the Waq clan located in contemporary Central Asia and Xinjiang, China. 3",,,,,,,,
393,Euclid,2," SCP-393 is an ordinary 9 cm x 14 cm blue day planner with a year embroidered into its cover that always matches the current year. The information on the back of the day planner reveals it to be a product of ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ publishing. SCP-393 has the ability to 'link' to a nearby subject via unknown means. Once linked, the day planner will appear in the hands of its owner whenever it is not being watched. Additionally, any event written in the past dates of the day planner are instantly recalled by the subject as if they experienced it themselves. Events written in a future date of SCP-393 will elicit no change until the date of the event has passed, at which time the subject will recall the event. If the subject currently linked with SCP-393 dies, SCP-393 will choose a new owner within ten minutes of the previous owner's demise, based on proximity. There appears to be no maximal distance for this ability (for additional details, see  testing log ).",,,,,,,,
394,Safe,1," SCP-394 is a container of ear candles, each 24 cm long and 1.2 cm in diameter, one end tapered. The container originally held twenty-four packs with two candles per pack with seventeen packs remaining. The ear candles are hollow tubes of  amatl  coated with beeswax and various herbs. Most of the herbs used are common aromatics, but some remain unidentified.",,,,,,,,

397,Safe,1," SCP-397 is a female chimpanzee standing 1.27m (4ft, 2in) in height and weighing 40.82kg (90lbs) exhibiting human-level sapience. SCP-397 can read and speak both English and the local dialect of [REDACTED] proficiently and is able to write in a somewhat legible shorthand. Standard testing measures an IQ of approximately 160, though this number may be inflated due to the distinctly non-standard nature of the subject. SCP-397 has demonstrated an intense desire to utilize its abilities to read and write, showing particular interest in the fields of ancient history and classical music. Its studies in these fields have been supervised by Dr. ¦¦¦¦¦¦, whose curriculum carefully excludes any in-depth tactical reviews of military history or advanced political theory. SCP-397 has shown particular interest in the works of Franz Liszt, Tacitus, Seneca, and Sergei Rachmaninoff.",,,,,,,,
398,Euclid,2," SCP-398 appears to all subjects as a hallway of some description; however, details differ between accounts. It is first seen as a hallway with white walls, plain wooden doors twenty (20) metres apart and approximately two (2) metres high, and brass handles, with no special attributes visible. This detail is consistent across all accounts. It was found on location at [DATA EXPUNGED] and upon investigation, a Dimensional Containment Site was set up around it. The remainder of the original building surrounding it is unremarkable and has been demolished as such.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-398/long_hallway_JeffK.jpg,,,,,,,

401,Euclid,2," SCP-401 was discovered near the French city of ¦¦¦¦¦¦ when agents responded to reports of the ground bleeding. When led to the site, investigators found a human mouth embedded in the soil, licking away the remaining blood with a long prehensile tongue. It was not until a week later that agents realized that the mouth was part of the root structure of what at first appeared to be a forty (40) meter tall dead eucalyptus tree with branches shaped like multi-jointed human arms. The white colour of the trunk, originally suggesting that the tree was dead, was found to be because the bark was made of human bone tissue. It was given SCP status and excavated from the area, to be transported to Site-¦¦.",,,,,,,,
402,Euclid,2," SCP-402 is an irregularly-shaped solid weighing 4kg. While SCP-402 is composed largely of obsidian, trace amounts of platinum and iridium are present. SCP-402's structure has numerous abnormal microscopic gaps similar to those found in  SCP-148 ; this, along with SCP-402's anomalous density (22.2g/cm 3 , roughly 8.5 times that of obsidian), suggests that the two materials operate under similar principles.",,,,,,,,
403,Safe,1," SCP-403 is a visually unremarkable naptha-fueled lighter that was discovered in a cafeteria at Site-¦¦. When lit once after a prolonged period of disuse, SCP-403 produces an ordinary flame. However, if ignited repeatedly within 24 hours the flame produced by SCP-403 becomes larger and more violent in nature with each subsequent ignition.",,,,,,,,
404,Safe,1," SCP-404 is a pair of large manila envelopes, one of which has a series of pages attached to the front. Each page is stamped with a name/date/time/number table and contains multiple entries with known and unknown names. The ink has been dated to 1833, ±10 years and the folder dated to 1834, ±10 years. Many signatures are noted on the grid, notably those of former Document Repository Administrators ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ (dated ¦¦-¦¦-¦¦¦¦), ¦¦¦ (dated ¦¦-¦¦-¦¦¦¦), and ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ (dated ¦¦-¦¦-¦¦¦¦). All signatures also are followed by a numerical reference number. Currently there are over 1000 signatures on these pages with additional pages appearing on their own when the previous ones become full. A count of these pages has proven impossible as has the contents of the envelope as mentioned later.",,,,,,,,
,,3, SCP-405 is a contagious phenomenon of unknown origin that causes the uncontrolled development of telepathic capabilities in humans. The typical progression of the disease is as follows. (¦¦% of cases do not follow this pattern.),,,,,,,,
406,Euclid,2," SCP-406 is a 228-metre-long disused railway tunnel in Crigglestone, England. The eastern entrance has been infilled and is inaccessible. The western entrance is blocked by a metal fence with a locked gate.",http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-406/1066529_0ca423c3.jpg,,,,,,,
407,Neutralized,0," SCP-407 is a song in an unidentified language, seemingly sung a cappella. The voices are thought to be human. The tape containing SCP-407 was found with one track of approximately thirty (30) minutes duration, though the abrupt ending suggests there may be more. The song has been described by all listeners as something along the lines of 'soothing', 'glorious', and 'beautiful'.",,,,,,,,
408,Safe,1," SCP-408 is a large mass of Lepidoptera, taking the appearance of zebra butterflies when not camouflaged. SCP-408 acts as a single entity at all times, speculated to be a form of hive mind communication amongst the mass. When inactive, SCP-408 will take on the color, pattern, and even texture of its immediate surroundings, making them functionally invisible. When threatened, SCP-408 has been observed to take on the form and appearance of a number of threatening creatures as a defense method, including a pride of lions, a Tyrannosaurus Rex, and most notably  SCP-682  (See Incident Log 682-C).",,,,,,,,
409,Keter,3," SCP-409 resembles a large quartz crystal approximately 1.5m (5ft) tall and 0.6m (2ft) wide. Any objects coming in contact with SCP-409 will begin to crystallize after three hours. This effect will occur in any material other than granite. The crystallization will spread by approximately 2.5cm (1in) per minute, and will convert the entire object or organism, inside and out. Subjects report this effect to be extremely painful, and similar to frostbite. After complete crystallization, the object will begin to make snapping and creaking noises for approximately twenty minutes, before bursting into thousands of fragments with great force.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-409/297px-Giant1standingmy8.jpg,,,,,,,
410,Safe,1," SCP-410 is a colony of fourteen (14) individual beetles (designated  Scarabaeus scriptor  by staff coleopterist Dr. Langstrom), each measuring approximately 5cm and possessing a carapace color variation from light blue to deep emerald green. A visual examination reveals nothing distinctive from other members of the genus  Scarabaeus  with regards to their appearance (number of legs, wings, eyes, etc). Dissection of a single member of the colony by a trained coleopterist showed no discernible anomalies in internal morphology with the exception of a small additional organ (designated the ""scriptorgan"" by Dr. Langstrom) capable of producing a variety of fluids both caustic and inert. It is worth noting that following the death and dissection of this member of the colony, a ""replacement"" beetle larva was seen fourteen (14) days later and grew to full maturity within one month.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-410/scp410beetle.gif,,,,,,,

412,Safe,1," SCP-412 is an antique silver hand mirror measuring 18 cm by 7 cm. The mirror has a 4 cm crack in the top left hand corner, and has an etched motif of roses and vines. Around ¦¦% of subjects within direct line of sight of SCP-412 report a compulsion to pick up the item and view their reflection in it. There does not appear to be a discernible pattern to the 'selections' - testing for possible genetic, mental, or other selection markers is ongoing.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-412/scp412.jpg,,,,,,,
413,Safe,1," SCP-413 is a four-story parking garage located in [REDACTED]. Inside, SCP-413 has a variable environment that dynamically alters itself. In effect, SCP-413 is able to change its internal structure, such as moving ramps, adding floors, changing stair cases, and so on. However, when observed from the outside, there is no indication of any of these changes taking place. While accurate measurement of SCP-413's interior has proven impossible, it is well established that the interior is larger than the building's external dimensions, and that the interior dimensions are constantly changing.",,,,,,,,
414,Keter,3," SCP-414 is a phenomenon that targets asocial humans and is categorized into two derivative effects, SCP-414-1 and SCP-414-2. The asociality may range from minor introversion to complete isolation. SCP-414 primarily affects individuals under the NEET 1  demographic with no regional preferences. SCP-414 begins when a humanoid in a circular mask, referred to as SCP-414-1, appears in front of a targeted human. SCP-414-1 typically claims to be an employee for a local social work organization.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-414/SierraLeone016.jpg,,,,,,,
,Safe,1," SCP-415 is a 176.9 centimeter tall Caucasian male of 36 years. He has blue eyes, receding brown hair, and appears to be human. Subject exhibits an average IQ and a relatively stable personality given his situation. He is cooperative with on-site staff, though is nervous around medical equipment and personnel.",,,,,,,,
416,Euclid,2," SCP-416 is an oblong area of forest located in the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ in northern ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦. Though its true borders are not known (and indeed may be in a constant state of flux), estimates place its ""center"" at ¦¦°¦¦ N, ¦¦°¦¦¦ W. It displays remarkable spatial anomalies, the most notable of which is that once entered, it is impossible to leave on foot; the only personnel to escape the area inside SCP-416 were extracted by an aerial reconnaissance team. Though from the air SCP-416 appears identical to the surrounding coniferous forests, it displays a bewildering array of plant life; species as varied as Joshua trees ( Yucca brevifolia ), Grandidier's baobab ( Adansonia grandidieri ), Wollemi pine ( Wollemia nobilis ), and manchineel trees ( Hippomane mancinella ) have been observed. No explanation has been offered as to how these species arrived and propagated. All observations indicate that SCP-416 is entirely devoid of animal, fungal, or insect life. Personnel deployed inside SCP-416 report that the entire area is continually overcast with fog despite satellite evidence to the contrary.",,,,,,,,
417,Euclid (Potentially Keter),5," SCP-417 resembles an African baobab tree in general size and structure, though it lacks leaves, giving it a dead appearance. Its bark has a drab, off-colour appearance. Despite the absence of leaves, SCP-417 bears fruit every sundown. Small buds form as the sun rises and the fruit grows and matures quickly over the course of the day, before ripening into pomegranate-sized, hard-husked fruit. This fruit has dark purple-black skin and a mostly smooth texture that grows pebbly as it becomes overripe. This hard husk may be cut or peeled away by hand or with tools.",,,,,,,,
,,5,,,,,,,,,
419,Safe,1," SCP-419 is a large pane of reinforced glass 1.5m x 3.6m x 7.6cm in dimensions. One side of SCP-419 does not allow light to pass through. Instead, it displays a view of what appears to be an extradimensional urban environment. This phenomenon is only present when viewed directly by a human subject. Photographs, motion sensors, and vision-enhancing objects such as glasses or contacts all act on SCP-419 as if it were a mirror. The scene viewed through SCP-419 appears to be outside but lacks any natural lighting, regardless of the time it is viewed. No super-terrestrial forms (such as celestial bodies) are visible. The view would appear to originate from a vantage point high above ground level. Approximately 800 lux of light emanates from SCP-419 despite the lack of a light source. The source of this phenomenon is theorized to be whatever environment SCP-419 displays. Light from SCP-419's testing chamber does not affect this scene.",,,,,,,,
420,Safe,1," SCP-420 is a dirty bottle of [REDACTED]-brand whiskey with no lid; when emptied, a small amount of whiskey-like liquid (SCP-420-1) remains in the bottle, appearing as liquid adhering to the sides. This liquid pools back into a few milliliters of SCP-420-1 over time. Drinking SCP-420-1 will cause SCP-420-2, a nonfatal but consuming degeneration and mutation of skin and keratinous tissue (hair, fingernails, etc.) in the infected. Cases of SCP-420-2 should be contained for further study. Early cases can be treated (see Treatment, below). SCP-420-2 has only been shown to affect humans.",,,,,,,,
421,Euclid,2," SCP-421 is an organism comprised entirely of driftwood and other oceanic waste. The exact configuration of the organism appears to be in constant flux, but typically consists of a centralized body of relatively tightly packed driftwood surrounded by a shoal of smaller organisms similar in appearance and behaviour to fish. Individual members of the shoal are regularly subsumed or created from the main body and have demonstrated no ability to reconfigure themselves while separated from the bulk of SCP-421. It is hypothesised that SCP-421 possesses a hive intelligence similar to that observed in social insects; members of the SCP-421 shoal are able to travel independently for ¦¦ km, beyond which they lose integrity and are reduced to simple driftwood with no known anomalous properties.",,,,,,,,
422,Safe,1," SCP-422 is a large quadruped, 83 centimeters at the shoulder and weighing 53 kg, though size and weight vary minutely from day to day. SCP-422 is constructed entirely out of large pieces of the bodies of other animals, stitched in place with muscle fiber and trace amounts of cartilage. The creature’s major organs appear to be composed of portions of other organs, though a given organ will only be made of portions of that type of organ (e.g., its heart is made of connecting chambers of other hearts). It has a flat face with two mismatched eyes- one green cat-like eye and one brown with a horizontal pupil like a goat. Its nose consists of two small slits just below the eyes, and its mouth is abnormally wide, stitched about the corners in such a way that it appears to be grinning. Its back legs are also much longer than its front legs, resembling a frog’s legs with an abnormal number of joints.",,,,,,,,
423,Safe,1," SCP-423 has no physical form. It appears to exist entirely within textual narratives. It was discovered in a used book store in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, Texas, on ¦¦¦¦ ¦¦, 19¦¦, in a copy of  Tom Sawyer . The book was purchased by Agent ¦¦¦¦¦¦, who located it during a routine search.",,,,,,,,
424,Safe,1," SCP-424 was discovered accidentally in early 2004 at a gas station in Campbell River, British Columbia. Documentation of discovery and capture can be found in Log #424-B, Files 424-1~10. SCP-424, at rest, appears to be a smooth, gelatinous mass, with equal black-and-white colouration. No patterns are observed to form on its surface while in this resting position, though the shades constantly shift position. In actuality, SCP-424 is a vast collection of microscopic organisms. Whether they function as a group, or by a single (or multiple) consciousness(es) is unknown, as samples taken display behaviour similar, yet independent, to that of the main mass. Origin of pigmentation is currently under investigation, but not prioritised under main research staff.",,,,,,,,
425,Euclid,2," SCP-425 appears to be a 1958 Philco Tandem Predicta television set. It was first reported in 1963 by the owner of the unit, ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦. Mrs. ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ originally contacted the FBI regarding the SCP, stating that it had begun to behave erratically at certain times. She reported to the FBI that her son, ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, had begun having terrible nightmares and had scratched ""8 = 8"" on the left side panel of the television set. Mrs. ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ further reported that although she had unplugged the set, it continued to broadcast without power at certain times during the day. Embedded Agent ¦¦¦¦¦¦ became aware of the situation and brought SCP-425 to the Foundation.",,,,,,,,
426,Euclid,2," Hello, I am SCP-426. I must be introduced this way in order to prevent ambiguity. I am an ordinary toaster, able to toast bread when supplied with electricity. However, when any human being mentions me, they inadvertently refer to me in the first person. Despite all attempts, there is yet to be a way to speak or write about me in the third person. When in my continuous presence for over two months, individuals begin to identify themselves as a toaster. Unless forcibly restrained, these people will ultimately harm themselves in their attempts to emulate my standard functions.",,,,,,,,
427,Safe* (see containment procedures),4," SCP-427 is a small, spherical, ornately carved locket made of a polished silver material. The ornate carvings do not seem to serve any function; it is unknown whether SCP-427's outer casing was crafted by sentients or not. Its circumference at its widest point is roughly 3 cm.",,,,,,,,
428,Euclid,2," SCP-428 is, in appearance, a crowd of huddled human beings. As of 20/12/¦¦ it consists of fourteen (14) people. While huddled in a circle, SCP-428 is to be considered in a ‘dormant’ state. In this state, the crowd moves with a gentle sway and can be heard audibly mumbling. Upon further inspection, the biological internals (organs, bones, muscles and fluids, leaving only the skin) have been removed from each individual and replaced with an unidentified material that attaches to a central amorphous mass in the middle of the crowd via lengths of flesh similar to umbilical cords.",,,,,,,,
,,6, SCP-429 is a complex device constructed of brass and leather designed to fit over an individual's right hand. There are a total of 7 controls on SCP-429:,,,,,,,,
430,Euclid,2," SCP-430 is a cylindrical gibbet approximately 3m tall and 0.7m in diameter, weighing ca. 800kg, composed of an unknown material - SCP-430 resists attempts to obtain bulk material samples, and attempts at indentation testing resulted in hardness values inconsistent with other properties 1 . Samples of surface corrosion are obtainable, and are chemically identical to hydrated ferrous oxide. On the lower rim, the numerals ""1772"" and name ""Hans Drechsler"" are carved.",,,,,,,,
431,Euclid,2," SCP-431 is the designation given to Dr. Gideon, a man who appears to have been a Foundation researcher. Due to the condition of records at present, it is not known if Gideon is his real name. The existence of SCP-431 was first discovered during what appeared to be an attempt to hack the Foundation database: a number of documents were altered to state that a scientist referred to as ""Dr. Gideon"" was involved in researching several SCP objects. However, it was determined that the documents in question were not being accessed at the time that they were modified.",,,,,,,,
432,Safe,1," SCP-432 is a 2-door steel storage cabinet, measuring 2 meters tall by 1.2 meters wide by 1 meter deep. The exterior of the cabinet is painted matte green and bears no remarkable features except small areas of corrosion and light scratching commensurate with being left exposed to the elements for a prolonged period of time. The doors of the cabinet are fitted with a basic slide-bolt and a hasp for a padlock, allowing the door to be secured from outside.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-432/SCP-432-video-frame.png,,,,,,,
433,Euclid,2," SCP-433 is a ritual described in document SCP-433-001. The ritual, when performed, results in the wholesale replacement of all matter within 11 m of the center of the ritual. All people, objects, terrain, and even gas is apparently removed and replaced with matter of unknown origin. See  Test Log 433-031  for details on matter replacements.",,,,,,,,
,,6," SCP-434 is an antique conference table. SCP-434 will not function unless at least eight chairs are placed around it. When a subject sits at SCP-434, physical duplicates of the subject will appear in 7 of the other chairs. These individuals, referred to as SCP-434-1 to SCP-434-7, possess all of the subject's memories and knowledge, but seemingly only a fragment of their personality. SCP-434-(1-7) are aware of their temporary nature and rarely react negatively to it. When questioned on the issue, they will state that they are elements of the subject and will live in him for all his life. The individuals remain for a full day after the subject leaves the table, after which they vanish, leaving no detectable traces. However, the individuals are more than capable of assaulting each other, other personnel and in rare cases, typically where the subject is mentally unstable, the subject themselves. While injuries have no lasting effect, the death of an individual results in a marked change in the personality of the subject, corresponding to the lack of the aspect embodied by that individual. SCP-434-(1-7) are as follows:",,,,,,,,
435,Keter,3," SCP-435-1 is a type III iron meteorite weighing approximately ¦¦,¦¦¦ kg, showing significant weathering. Spectroscopic and chemical analysis shows a composition over 99% iron, which at normal densities can only account for ¦¦% of the measured weight. Age is indeterminate, but analysis of weathering suggests it has been exposed to atmosphere for at least ¦¦,¦¦¦ years.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-435/breach.jpg,,,,,,,
436,Euclid,2," SCP-436 is a small locket, apparently made from gold. When opened, an inlaid photograph can be seen. It is unknown if the photograph is the source of SCP-436's effect, because this cannot be tested.",,,,,,,,
437,Euclid,2," SCP-437 is a large grove of trees located in Camp Lakewood, Illinois (USA). It contains 64 instances of SCP-437-A.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-437/tree1A.jpg,,,,,,,
438,Euclid,2," SCP-438 is a white canvas straitjacket of the Posey brand, dating to about 1930, fitted with straps of an unknown material. The jacket is designed for versatility and will fit and securely restrain some 95% of adult humans when properly adjusted.",,,,,,,,
439,Euclid,2," SCP-439 is an insect of unknown origin, somewhat resembling a greyish, semitranslucent  Forficula auricularia  (common earwig), approximately 2.5 cm in length. Originally located/obtained in mainland China in the ¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦ province. No other specimen has been found, as of yet.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-439/bonehive.jpg,,,,,,,
440,Euclid,2," SCP-440 is a sample of fine-grain sand (sand grain of approximately 90 micrometers) that is chemically identical to typical silica-based sand. Its only difference is that it functions as if it were in a microgravity environment, regardless of the gravitational forces acting upon it. SCP-440 was found in a small glass bottle with no label on it, filled with a viscous fluid that, presumably, weighs down SCP-440 and prevents the grains from touching.",,,,,,,,
441,Euclid,2," SCP-441 is an adult male Jacob Ram. Prolonged proximity to SCP-441 leads to a depressed immune system in humans. After approximately thirty minutes of exposure, D-class test subjects showed markedly decreased white blood cell counts. After an exposure of an hour or more, subjects display symptoms of severe immune deficiency. After ninety minutes or more, the immune systems of subjects generally do not recover, and death results from massive infection.",,,,,,,,
442,Euclid,2," SCP-442 is a gold-plated pocket watch three (3) centimeters in diameter with hands showing the hour and minute. Along the edge of the watch an inscription reads, ""To my good friend, a helping hand."" While no apparent seams allowing SCP-442 to be opened without damaging it have been found, scans of the interior of SCP-442 have revealed nothing unusual in its workings.",,,,,,,,
443,Safe,1," SCP-443 is a mostly complete 16-piece set of Crayola crayons, numbered SCP-443-01 through 14. The set is a model (BS0366) which was produced between 1997 and 1999, although the serial number on the packaging is outside the range of the product. Two crayons (""Blue Green"" and ""Violet/Purple"") are missing. SCP-443-05 is snapped in two pieces (05a and 05b), while SCP-443-09 had its non-writing end damaged in a nibbling incident involving  SCP-529  which, for this reason should be kept away from the items.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-443/443.jpg,,,,,,,
,,2,,,,,,,,,
445,Safe,1," SCP-445 consists of three stacks of white 11"" x 17"" paper. Each individual leaf has the text ""Dr. Wondertainment's Super Paper!"" stamped on the bottom-left corner. While in its natural state, SCP-445 cannot be torn or burned, water has no adverse effect on it, and glue or tape will not stick to SCP-445. Observation of SCP-445 has found that its fibers are much denser than normal paper fibers at 3000 kg/m 3 , and a micro-layer of an unidentifiable substance is coated on each individual fiber.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-445/FWTgj28XwAAhU3s.jpg,,,,,,,
446,Safe,1," SCP-446 in its normal state appears to be a Caucasian female, early twenties, brown hair 17.78 cm at its longest point, unusually bright blue eyes, light skin with a tattoo of the Marshall, Carter and Dark logo on its lower back, 1.75 m tall and weighing 52.16 kg. SCP-446 is anatomically correct, at least on the outside. All physical characteristics are consistent with a living human, including skin tone and texture, eye color and clarity of the sclera, even body heat. SCP-446 does not respond to any communication, however, and also does not breathe or exhibit a pulse.",,,,,,,,
447,Safe,1," SCP-447-1 is a green sphere approximately 5 cm in diameter, with a spongy surface texture and a weight of 1.37 kg. The object is warm to the touch, approximately the same temperature as a human body, although its core temperature is slightly higher. Personnel handling SCP-447-1 have reported no adverse effects, so long as SCP-447-1 does not come into contact with a dead body.",,,,,,,,
448,Safe,1," Object appears to be a child's Jack-in-the-box toy. The box portion is 13cm along each side and is constructed of tin, with a colorful decal depicting a smiling clown on each facet of the box except for the bottom and right side, which holds the turn crank. When cranked, the toy plays ""Pop Goes the Weasel"", causing the ""Jack"" to leap out the top before the final five notes, as most toys of its kind normally do.",,,,,,,,
449,Euclid,2," Each instance of SCP-449 is a twisting aluminium cone, loosely resembling a cornucopia. Each is 40 centimetres long with a mouth approximately 15 centimetres in diameter, weighing slightly more than a kilogram. On the side of each is stamped the word “JOY”. For unknown reasons, all instances tarnish very easily.",,,,,,,,
450,Euclid,2," SCP-450 is the death row block of the abandoned ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ Federal Penitentiary in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦. Distance from entrance to the execution chamber is approximately 166.5 meters. A complex pattern,  drawn in human blood , is located on the wall behind the electric chair. This pattern slowly degrades over time due to normal environmental decay and must be maintained regularly.",,,,,,,,
451,Euclid,2," SCP-451, formerly Agent M¦¦¦¦¦ J¦¦¦¦, is a Caucasian male, 33 years of age and 1.6 m tall. SCP-451 can not perceive the presence or actions of other human beings. Changes made to the immediate environment are generally not noted by SCP-451 unless his attention is elsewhere for any arbitrary period of time. Certain changes to SCP-451's surroundings are misinterpreted, including all attempts to communicate with him and any clear evidence of direct human intervention. Study may be necessary to determine a pattern in what is perceived and what is not.",,,,,,,,
452,Euclid,2," SCP-452 is a colony of  Latrodectus hesperus  (Western American black widow) physically indistinguishable from normal spiders of its kind. SCP-452 has a preference to spin webs near areas where humans sleep, and when allowed to freely roam, will attempt to relocate if no humans sleep near its web for extended periods of over a week.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-452/scp452.jpg,,,,,,,
453,Euclid,2," SCP-453 is a nightclub located in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, Italy, currently owned and operated entirely by Foundation personnel. Every night, an apparently random assortment of civilians from ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ and adjoining municipalities arrive at the club; although the night invariably begins identically to any other club, over the course of the night the civilians present fall into ""roles"" in one of ¦¦¦ currently documented sequences of events (termed ""Scripts"" by Foundation operatives working on SCP-453). Over the course of the evening, generally according to Script, civilians will depart the club and return home, maintaining only partial memories of the night. All surviving civilians depart before 0400 every night.",,,,,,,,
454,Safe,1," SCP-454 is a comic book, titled “The Crypt of Terror” The front cover has the picture of a female, nervously looking around, with a shadowy figure some distance behind her. The price is listed as ten cents and the issue number is seventeen. The item bears slight damage from age and normal wear. Although the cover mentions a werewolf, the story does not.",,,,,,,,
455,Euclid,2," SCP-455 is a large cargo ship currently run aground on the southern coast of Chile. Most of its structure is underwater and badly damaged, with rust coating 85 to 90 percent of all surfaces. Internal structure appears to be significantly larger than external dimensions, and is not flooded despite large holes visible on outer hull.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-455/Wrecktophg4.jpg,,,,,,,
456,Safe,1," SCP-456 is a variety of the common bedbug ( Cimex lectularius ). In addition to an anticoagulant, SCP-456 injects [DATA EXPUNGED] when biting its host, causing the brain to produce adenosine, endorphins, and a narcotic identified as an analogue of fentanyl. As a result, victims of SCP-456 infestations experience increasing euphoria and somnolence as the number of insects increases, eventually sleeping 24 hours/day.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-456/bug.jpg,,,,,,,
457,Euclid/Potential Keter,5," For all points and purposes, SCP-457 appears to be a sentient being composed of flame. SCP-457's actual composition is unknown, and has proven to be invisible and undetectable by any known means, but is shaped out by the flames it produces, often assuming a human-like form if given sufficient fuel to assume that size. SCP-457's most rudimentary form appears to be that of a single flame, comparable in size to that of a matchstick. In this form, SCP-457 possesses only the simplest of directives and shows no signs of being unusual compared to any other flame beyond a penchant for suddenly flickering to burn human hands, and the ability to 'jump' to more flammable materials or other flames, which it then assimilates into its total form.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-457/scp-457-new.png,,,,,,,
458,Safe,1," SCP-458 is a large-sized pizza box from the pizza chain Little Caesar's, of their Hot-n-Ready variety. It is made of simple cardboard, measures 25.4cmx25.4cmx2.54cm (10inx10inx1in), and weighs about 20 to 20.49 grams depending on toppings. As a result of the unusual nature of SCP-458, measurement of weight is inconsistent.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-458/scp-458.jpg,,,,,,,
459,Safe,1," SCP-459 appears to be a standard home thermostat. The item is equipped with a small display, four buttons, and two dials on either side of the screen; the two buttons on the right side raise and lower temperature, and the other two appear to affect relative humidity in the area - However, these buttons will only work when both dials are set to the off position. The left dial (Dial 1) is marked with several standard weather conditions including ""rain"", ""snow"", and [DATA EXPUNGED].  The fourth and fifth positions' lettering has worn off, and have been marked as 4 and 5.  The fourth and fifth positions have been respectively designated ""T-storm"" and ""Hurricane"". The right dial (Dial 2) has ¦¦ different settings, all of which are unmarked. The rightmost positions on each dial are the ""off"" positions.",,,,,,,,
460,Euclid,2," SCP-460 is a free-floating mass of cumulonimbus, with an average diameter of 3.5 km. Normally, SCP-460 takes the form of a large ring, and is unaffected by standard meteorological conditions that a cloud of its shape and size would be. The composition of the cloud itself is typical, with frozen water (H 2 O) making up 98.7%. However, the remaining 1.3% of the cloud consists of a highly active form of ectoplasm, which lends to SCP-460’s unique properties.",,,,,,,,
461,Safe,1," SCP-461 is a 25-inch cathode ray tube (CRT) television of unknown origin, although it outwardly resembles a Zenith unit manufactured in the early 1980s. The model number is “ZT-035,” but this does not correspond to any known Zenith television. Once a day, at exactly 0300 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), SCP-461 self-activates and displays video footage lasting precisely five minutes. The nature of the footage varies widely, but it is never a conventional broadcast. Instead of standard television programming, SCP-461 displays what appears to be video feeds of closed-circuit security cameras in both commercial and residential settings. All footage appears contemporary and transmitted ""live.""",,,,,,,,
462,Safe,1," SCP-462 is a 1968 Chevrolet El Camino in a state of serious disrepair, with several broken windows and severe rust damage. A single key is inserted into the ignition. To date, all attempts at removing the key have failed. If a human sits in the driver's seat and turns the key as if to start the vehicle, they will instantaneously disappear. Around 42% of SCP-462’s drivers have been known to suddenly reappear without the vehicle at a distant location after a random period of time, ranging from 43 seconds to 7 months, near the spot that they have confirmed as being their chosen destination. These drivers rarely arrive at their destination safely; many have been observed falling from a considerable height after reappearing, while others have arrived while flying in the direction of their destination at various speeds, resulting in injuries that are sometimes fatal. Occasionally, test subjects will arrive in various states of dismemberment. In 35% of these cases, the test subject never reappears and cannot be located, even when fitted with a GPS transceiver. The remaining 23% of test subjects [DATA EXPUNGED].",,,,,,,,
463,Safe,1," SCP-463 is a small silver spoon, approximately 17.5 cm in length, with a mass of approximately 153 g. Unless handled by a human, SCP-463 displays no abnormal behavior. Neutron imaging, MRI, and the [REDACTED] imaging system have revealed no detail to the inner structure. All analysis of SCP-463 is consequently limited to its directly observable effects.",,,,,,,,
464,Euclid,2," Discovered in 19¦¦, SCP-464 is a large building located in the middle of a farm near ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦¦¦¦¦. The building consists of ten rooms, one of which takes up 70% of the building. The remaining nine rooms vary in size and function and take up two stories at the rear of the building.",,,,,,,,
465,Safe,1," SCP-465-01 is a large two-piece cardboard box decorated with a faded confetti pattern popular in the 1970s. Other than a large printed label on the top of the lid marked ""Party in a Box"", no indication of contents or manufacturer are found on any portion of the object. When any human subject completely removes the lid of SCP-465-01, an array of decorations, furniture, and a group of at least 20 people (collectively SCP-465-02) appear spontaneously in the room or immediate vicinity in which the box was opened. These individuals proceed to celebrate raucously, and actively attempt to include the subject in their festivities (primarily dancing and consumption of alcohol). Though most members of SCP-465-02 are persistent in these attempts, and several of them extremely persuasive, the subject does not appear to be compelled to participate. Should the subject attempt to leave the party, additional members of SCP-465-02 will manifest at any location that the subject visits for the duration of the ""party"".",,,,,,,,
466,Euclid,2," It is unknown if SCP-466 is a separate pathogen affecting a human host, or the human host itself. Current theory suggests the former. For clarity, the host individual will be referred to as SCP-466-2 and the possible infective agent as SCP-466-1.",,,,,,,,
467,Safe,1," SCP-467 appears to be an empty phone booth, and was found in [DATA EXPUNGED]. The SCP Foundation discovered it due to a legend about a 'haunted phone' that used to reside inside the booth, although testing has revealed that the phone was of no importance, and the effects came from the booth itself. Even after the phone was removed, the booth itself remained a place of superstition before being recovered by [DATA EXPUNGED].",,,,,,,,
468,Euclid,2," SCP-468-1 is an abacus with dimensions of 20 by 7 centimeters, in near-perfect condition, with no missing beads or signs of disrepair. Its beads, despite the lack of any obvious motor or driving system, will move autonomously. Periods of movement are interspersed by periods of rest, which usually last three to five hours. SCP-468-1’s beads will often perform basic arithmetic operations, though this is not always the case.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-468/Chinese-abacus.jpg,,,,,,,
469,Keter,3," SCP-469 appears to be a gargantuan mound of large avian wings with white, glossy feathers, curled into a massive ball measuring 8.84m (29ft) in diameter and weighing several tons. Each wing varies in size and span, ranging from a few centimeters to several meters, with the largest estimated to be at least 53m (173.8ft) in length, and branch off one another in seemingly random, fractal-like arrays.",http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-469/scp%20469.jpg,,,,,,,
470,Euclid,2," SCP-470 appears to be a large abandoned office building in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦. SCP-470 has had no registered owner since ¦¦¦¦, when it was abandoned with the collapse of the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ Corporation. The building is seven floors, including basement levels, and in a general state of disrepair consistent with its term of abandonment.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-470/IMG_3784.jpg,,,,,,,
471,Euclid,2," SCP-471 is an artificial satellite currently in an elliptical orbit around Earth. SCP-471 appears identical to Satellite ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦-¦, a weather satellite launched by [REDACTED] in 197¦. Though SCP-471 superficially resembles Satellite ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦-¦, additional equipment of unknown purpose can be seen on its backside. Photographs and manufacture reports have confirmed that this equipment was not present at the launch of Satellite ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦-¦. It is unknown whether Satellite ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦-¦ was altered after launch or replaced entirely sometime later. SCP-471 has continued transmitting the same weather information Satellite ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦-¦ has been responsible for, which allowed SCP-471 to go undetected for decades.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-471/satellite.jpg,,,,,,,
472,,6," SCP-472 is a red garnet, of the pyrope-spessartite variety, of unusual size (1.8 carat). The phrase ""For man looketh on the outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart"" has been engraved in 2 mm (0.08 in) high lettering on the stone's surface. Relevance of the phrase is unknown.",,,,,,,,
473,Euclid,2," SCP-473 is a wrecked Spanish galleon typical of those used in the early 16th century. It is resting on the ocean floor at ¦¦º¦¦'¦¦""N ¦¦¦º¦¦'¦¦""W. SCP-473 was brought to the attention of the Foundation after the loss of a research vessel operated by [REDACTED] University. A Search and Rescue team which approached SCP-473 reported audio anomalies ""like giggling, and pleading for help"". They reported voices in English, Spanish and an unrecognized language. Agents embedded in [REDACTED] immediately moved to cancel the search, declaring the crew and vessel lost.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-473/SCP-473.jpg,,,,,,,
474,Euclid,2," SCP-474 denominates pills produced for non-medicinal purposes by Alexylva University in apparent collaboration with the Oneiroi Collective. Each occurrence of SCP-474 is blue, and analysis has shown it to be chemically identical to generic sugar-based placebo pills.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-474/474.JPG,,,,,,,
475,,5," SCP-475 is an ornate sculpture of soap depicting an unidentified Pope. Inscribed at the base of the statue is the phrase ""Cleanliness is next to Godliness."" Analysis reveals the object to be composed of long-chain saturated fatty acids (CH 3 -(CH 2 ) n ), totaling 89.7% of its mass, with the remaining 10.3% corresponding to ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦-¦¦¦¦, attached as the hydrophilic head. It is believed that the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦-¦¦¦¦ gives SCP-475 its unique properties, but all attempts to recreate this compound have failed.",,,,,,,,
476,Safe,1," SCP-476 is a 60-page Rand McNally  Canada Road Atlas  published in 2006 (ISBN 0-88640-¦¦¦-¦) by the Canadian Cartographics Corporation. Upon closer examination, it is revealed to contain a large number of anomalies such as locations that do not exist, missing locations, and misplaced or misnamed ones. Indices and distance chart are consistent with the anomalous maps. A tentative list of anomalies can be found in document SCP-476a.",,,,,,,,
477,Euclid,2," Site 44 is located upon and encloses a thin layer of Cambrian shale covering approximately 2 square km of a mesa in Zavkhan province, Mongolia. Within the stone is a high concentration of what appear to be aquatic fossils from the Precambrian era, collectively known as SCP-477. These anomalous fossils are capable of motion, appearing to “swim” through sedimentary rock as though it were shallow water.",,,,,,,,
478,Euclid,2," SCP-478 are small entities of inconsistent size and shape that resemble a darkly-coloured butterfly or moth in flight. Wild instances have been encountered a number of times, but their elusive nature makes capture difficult. Extracted instances of SCP-478 do not seem to need to eat, sleep, breathe, or breed.",,,,,,,,
479,Euclid,2," Hallway 4 is a 25m long hallway connecting the plant room in the Site 14 D-class dormitories to the laundry room. As of ¦¦/¦¦/20¦¦, persons entering Hallway 4 have mentioned powerful visual, auditory and olfactory hallucinations of blood, ranging from isolated blood spots on the floor to ""blood raining upwards, hitting the floor from the other side like it's the pane of a window"".",http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-479/Schiffbau_tunnel_small.jpg,,,,,,,
480,Euclid,2," SCP-480 is a localized electromagnetic field generated by an unseen and as yet unknown source, capable of inducing substantial changes to human consciousness and physiology.",,,,,,,,
481,Euclid,2," SCP-481 was originally a clustered pattern of scars, roughly corresponding to a variably partial map of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, India, appearing on SCP-481-1 (formerly Ms. ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦-¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦) since at least 199¦. SCP-481 has since spread to SCP-481-2 (formerly Agent ¦¦¦¦¦, see Addendum 481-01). When SCP-481 first manifested on SCP-481-1, it appeared as a small series of criss-crossing scars that has been found to correspond to the neighborhood of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦. While it is still not readily apparent why this town is being mapped, the sympathetic effects of the scars and city are readily apparent.",,,,,,,,
482,Euclid,2," SCP-482 is a black leather straitjacket of similar make to the ¦¦¦ brand. Although the jacket seems to made for the Medium size, testing has shown that it can fit most body sizes; subjects with larger body types report, however, that they feel “compressed” or “suffocated” while wearing it. The words “Made in Tsiao-yan, China / Hand Wash Only / No Aserejena Powder” are present on the manufacturer’s tag in faded text. Neither the factory nor the item “Aserejena” exist on any known records. Finally, while there are no obvious signs of wear and tear on the item, there are several small cuts on the straps. Analysis has shown that these could not have been inflicted by anyone wearing SCP-482. Testing has shown that while immune to any damage due to body changes occurred by the subject, it can be damaged by external forces as normal for an object of this material. Further destructive testing on SCP-482 has been suspended due to the lack of viable duplicates.",,,,,,,,
483,Safe,1," SCP-483 is a standard orange prescription bottle filled with up to 50 spherical, gray tablets (SCP-483-1). The label indicates that it was issued to a ""Sherman, David A."", and in place of a prescription name, the label reads ""anti-aging"". The remainder of the label has been torn off. Analysis of the tablets shows that they are chemically identical to placebos.",,,,,,,,
484,Safe,1," SCP-484 is a pharmaceutical of unknown origin originally discovered in use as a street drug in urban areas throughout the world. Interrogations of dealers has put a tentative first release around June, 200¦ in ¦¦¦¦, Norway. As with most street drugs, the physical form of SCP-484 varies greatly from sample to sample. SCP-484 is generally found in pill form, though at least two types have been powders within a rapidly dissolving gel pack. Reports of a trans-dermal patch were received but no sample has been obtained to date. SCP-484 has a number of street names, with the most common being V, Vic (vik), Vicar (vi-'ker), and Care, each revolving around the word ""Vicarious"". Phrasal slang includes any mention of memories or remembering and name code uses V-names like Victor or Vivian.",,,,,,,,
485,Safe,1," SCP-485 appears to be a standard retractable pen with an unusually easy to click button. The pen itself was accidentally stolen by Dr. Dahij, upon renewing his life insurance policy. The pen once belonged to Agent ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ of ¦¦¦¦ Life Insurance Inc. Each time the pen's tip is extended, a random person known to the user dies by an unknown cause. Since the button's action is abnormally smooth, subjects during testing were noted to rapidly click the pen without conscious thought or realization of what was happening.",,,,,,,,
486,Safe,1," SCP-486 is a Hispanic female twenty-nine (29) years of age. The subject has black hair and brown eyes, is 158 centimeters in height, and weighs approximately 63 kilograms. The subject is missing her left arm from the elbow. Aside from this handicap and her condition, the subject shows the physical needs and characteristics of a normal human being.",,,,,,,,
487,Euclid,2," SCP-487 is a house located in the Northeastern United States in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦. The exact appearance and architecture of SCP-487 is impossible to definitively describe, as it constantly changes its appearance and structure depending on the arrangement of the items within it. Currently, SCP-487 appears as a significantly larger version of a Sears Catalog Home.",,,,,,,,
488,Euclid,2," SCP-488-1 is a location near Earth's L4 Lagrangian Point. Though direct observation of the location has shown nothing stationary to date, objects ranging from 0.5 m to 12 m in diameter will spontaneously appear at this location, and immediately accelerate towards the Earth. Composition varies slightly from object to object, but are consistent with rocks of extraterrestrial origin, and do not appear to be artificial. Most of these objects disintegrate and burn up in the atmosphere, but a meteor of sufficient mass to impact the surface will strike every six (6) to twelve (12) hours.",,,,,,,,
489,Euclid,2," SCP-489 is a roughly dome-shaped conglomerate mass consisting entirely of objects used to kill or repel insects  (e.g. aerosol pesticide cans, ""bug zappers"", flyswatters, footwear, and lighters) . Each item is capable of independent autonomous movement, though they usually move along the ground as a whole when in motion. As of June 17, 2013, SCP-489 measures roughly five meters in height, and eight meters in diameter at the base.",,,,,,,,
490,Safe,1," SCP-490 is an ice cream truck dating to the 1960s constructed by ¦¦¦¦. It seems to be mechanically standard except for the audio system, which does not respond to operators, though it appears to be in working order. The key to the vehicle is fastened in the ignition and cannot be extracted by any means. SCP-490 can be driven (fueled by a diesel engine originally made for the truck) and functions properly in all ways compared to other vehicles of the same model.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-490/490-1.jpg,,,,,,,
491,Euclid,2," SCP-491 is a lighthouse built in the early 20th century, located at ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦, Nova Scotia. The ocean floor surrounding SCP-491 contains numerous wrecked ships, which vary in time of origin, ranging from 1923 to 1987.",,,,,,,,
492,Safe,1," SCP-492 was formerly an animatronic dummy for a pirate attraction in the now abandoned ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ Amusement Park. Due to the nature of the amusement park it was found in, SCP-492 is primarily made of low-quality synthetic cloth, and all of the hydraulic and electronic components inside it had been removed. However, due to unknown circumstances, SCP-492 has gained motor skills and sentience.",,,,,,,,
493,Safe,1," SCP-493 is a group of genetically identical males of apparent ages between 20 and 90 years old. The younger SCP-493s have brown hair and brown eyes, are about 1.7m tall, and weigh between 70 and 90 kg, depending on diet and activity. Older SCP-493s' hair turns grey after beginning to bald around an apparent age of 50 years old. Each SCP-493 currently in containment is fluent in English and multiple dialects of German, speaking with a moderate Swiss-German accent. SCP-493-07 and SCP-493-08 are also fluent in Spanish. Seven instances of SCP-493 are currently in containment. From estimated duplication rates, it is believed that a minimum of twelve instances of SCP-493 have not yet been contained.",,,,,,,,
,,4,,,,,,,,,
495,Safe,1," SCP-495 appears to be the oven from a 1992 ToyMax ""Creepy Crawlers"" playset, save that the ""Creepy Crawlers"" logo sticker has been replaced with the logo from a 1964 Mattel ""Thingmaker"" hot-plate (a toy of virtually identical function to the more recent ToyMax version, discontinued by Mattel in the 1970's due to insufficient safety features).",,,,,,,,
496,Keter,3," SCP-496 is a substance composed primarily of calcium carbonate 1  that covers a 35 square kilometer area of the sea floor 84 kilometers off the coast of Jakarta, Indonesia. The substance has characteristics of a waterborne contagion that is capable of infecting an organism via contact with the skin. Once SCP-496 has infected an organic substance, it will begin the process of converting all organic matter of the subject into SCP-496.",https://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-496/Infection.jpg,,,,,,,
497,Euclid,2, SCP-497 appears to be an  Eustrombus gigas  conch seashell. Recordings have shown that SCP-497 continuously emits a very faint sound of voices screaming from within its shell. This sound dissipates a few inches away from the object.,http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-497/conch.jpg,,,,,,,
498,Safe,1," SCP-498 appears to be a Koway Brand RT-800 electronic alarm clock with yellow LED display, set to the U.S. Central Time Zone. When heard by a subject, the alarm has been seen to induce a state of increased alertness until reset. This effect prevents restful sleep in SCP-498's vicinity, although micro-naps are possible. Other than the ""snooze"" button and the display, none of the other functions on the device appear operational. Notably, the device continues to display time and require resetting even while not connected to a power source. Attempts to dismantle SCP-498 have not been successful in preventing it from activating, nor have they determined how it operates without an obvious power source.",,,,,,,,
499,Euclid,2," SCP-499 is a human male of indeterminate race standing 1.75 meters tall and of at least eighty years of age. There is heavy burn scarring present on the subject’s body, primarily on the face, hands, arms and chest. SCP-499’s eyes are severely damaged by light over-exposure, and its respiratory system by smoke inhalation rendering it effectively blind and mute. SCP-499 will remain passive to any direct interaction.",,,,,,,,
500,Safe,1," SCP-500 is a small plastic can which at the time of writing contains forty-seven (47) red pills. One pill, when taken orally, effectively cures the subject of all diseases within two hours, exact time depending on the severity and amount of the subject's conditions. Despite extensive trials, all attempts at synthesizing more of what is thought to be the active ingredient of the pills have been unsuccessful.",,,,,,,,
501,Euclid,2," Due to the nature of SCP-501's psychological effects when viewed, it is difficult to ascertain an accurate visual description. According to reports from D-class personnel who have had visual contact with SCP-501, it is an American one-dollar bill that radiates a glowing amber aura. Robotically controlled chemical analysis indicates that it is chemically identical to ordinary dollar-bills.",,,,,,,,
502,Safe,1," SCP-502 was obtained from the Doniphan County Coroner’s office in Troy, Kansas in 199¦. It was discovered by local coroner ¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦ during a routine autopsy of a Jared Thomas McIntyre following his death in a motorcycle collision. SCP-502 was located in the space that should have been occupied by the deceased’s heart and was attached to his pulmonary and circulatory systems. SCP-502 was later retrieved by SCP agents after ¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦ began circulating questions about the box.",,,,,,,,
503,Euclid,2," SCP-503 is a Caucasian male, sixty-three (63) years of age. The subject is bald (formerly black hair) with brown eyes. The subject’s lower jaw is a prosthesis, as a result of incident 503-A. There is a large scar on the subject’s chest as a result of Test Log 503-5.",,,,,,,,
504,Safe,1," SCP-504 is a species of tomato physically and genetically identical to that of the typical commercially-grown tomato. It was recovered in [REDACTED], Kentucky after a woman reported to the police that her farmer husband had been ""murdered by his lunch"". The Foundation is currently working to identify and destroy loose strains of SCP-504 in the surrounding commercial farming areas.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-504/tomato2.jpg,,,,,,,
505,Keter,3," SCP-505 is a Model ¦¦¦¦ Faber-Castell fountain pen, produced in 2001. For documentation of its acquisition by the Foundation, see Addendum 505-2. It is identical in all respects to a standard fountain pen apart from its association with SCP-505-1. SCP-505-1 is the black ink produced by SCP-505, which exhibits the property of self-replication. SCP-505-1 spreads at a variable rate, affected by the substance it comes into contact with and the amount of SCP-505-1 present. Quantities of SCP-505-1 have been shown to increase at rates between 0.5 and 540 mL per second. Standard ink-removing chemicals are able to partially remove SCP-505-1 and inhibit its spread; however, sodium hydroxide is necessary to remove SCP-505-1 contamination completely, and has shown to be ineffective in environments with particularly high SCP-505-1 concentrations. Fortunately, the growth rate of SCP-505-1 appears to be inversely proportional to its quantity at high concentrations. Whilst the observed effects of this are negligible in most cases, this inverse growth phenomenon provides the only explanation for the partial containment of SCP-505-1 despite a number of cases of large-scale environmental contamination which were projected to otherwise lead to an NK-class end-of-the-world scenario.",,,,,,,,
506,Safe,1, SCP-506 is a genetically engineered variant of zucchini ( Cucurbita pepo ) created by the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ Corporation as a hardy and rapid-growing food plant. SCP-506 exhibits several undesirable and dangerous qualities:,,,,,,,,
,Safe,1," SCP-507 is a Caucasian male with blond hair and green eyes, sporting no other outstanding characteristics besides being somewhat overweight and speaking with a vague accent of disputable origin. Although SCP-507 has an already-established name due to its unremarkable upbringing, it seems to find entertainment in forcing those it meets to give it a nickname in lieu of divulging this information. Thus SCP-507 will now respond to the names Tommy, Steve, Bruto, Guy, Houdini, and Grabnok the Destroyer.",,,,,,,,
508,Safe,1," SCP-508 appears to be a 'Random Dot Stereo-gram' poster, of dimensions 255x197cm. Caution must be taken when interacting with it, as even a cursory glance may fascinate the viewer, giving them an overwhelming desire to properly view the 'hidden' image. Viewing the image appears to only be possible when the viewer stands 1 meter in front of the image, and stares directly at it; attempts to view the image via mirrors or having multiple subjects attempt to view it have failed, with only the properly positioned subject able to see the image.",http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-508/Steregram_SCP.JPG,,,,,,,
509,Safe,1," SCP-509 is the collective term for two structures with similar and possibly linked anomalies. SCP-509-A is a wooden sauna located in Gaston, Oregon. When activated remotely, it functions as normal for an electric stove sauna, producing steam by dripping water onto a heated surface. Local records show that SCP-509-A was built in 1987, and exhibited no anomalous properties until shortly before its containment in 1995.",,,,,,,,
510,Keter,3," SCP-510 has thus far proven difficult to fully identify. It is possibly a form of microorganism or a form of “nanite”. The particles of SCP-510 appear to be surrounded by a field that causes a “blurring” effect even at high magnification. Tests have come back with wildly varying results, and samples have simultaneously exhibited properties of organic and non-organic matter, as well as properties of solids, liquids, and gasses. Current research views it as a form of mold or virus, due to its response to high heat and chemical sterilization.",,,,,,,,
511,Euclid,2, Instances of SCP-511 typically occur within residential structures with a block or stone foundation that includes a basement or crawlspace. All attempts to remove an instance of SCP-511 from such a residence have proved ineffective. (Ref:  Interview 511-A ),,,,,,,,
512,Safe,1, SCP-512 is a stainless steel black umbrella with a nylon canopy and polished ebony crook handle. Maximum radius of canopy when open is 0.75 m. Make and manufacture are unknown. A taped patch is visible on the canopy section.,,,,,,,,
513,Euclid,2," Physically, SCP-513 is an unremarkable, rusty cowbell. No marks or engravings are visible on its surface due to the large amount of corrosion. Attempts to remove the rust chemically or mechanically have had no success.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-513/Cowbell.JPG,,,,,,,
514,Euclid,2," SCP-514 is a flock of  Columba livia domestica , or Homing Pigeons. Visual analysis confirms that these pigeons are in fact the kind used in White Dove Release ceremonies. However, the type of ceremony they were used in, or the identity of who bred these doves is currently unknown.",,,,,,,,
515,Keter,3," SCP-515 is presently a Caucasian male of the approximate age of 14; no applicable birth certificate has yet been found, so all relevant personal information is the product of hypotheses and the subject of guesswork. His basal metabolic rate is comparable to that of a blue whale or a mammal of greater size, but mass is slightly below average for humans of similar ages.",,,,,,,,
516,Safe,1," SCP-516 is a standard model T-55 main battle tank. Records indicate it was manufactured in 19¦¦, at ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ Plant, Kharkiv, Ukrainian SSR, and that it had a normal period of service in the armed forces of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦. It exhibits wear and tear consistent with its age.",http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-516/tank.jpg,,,,,,,
517,Safe,1," SCP-517 is a fortune-telling machine. Item stands approximately 2 meters tall, containing a mechanical puppet and an electric candle within a glass and wooden case. Examination has shown an internal layout consistent with similar machines. On the top panels the words ""Grandmother Predictions"" are painted on built-in signage. The puppet within is in the shape of an elderly woman, with a white blouse and a blue shawl. Item's power cord has been severed approximately 15 centimeters from its base; it appears to have been inexpertly separated from its original power source.

521,Safe,1," SCP-521 is a red postbox, of a design commonly used in the United Kingdom by Royal Mail. Retrieved from ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, England, test results show SCP-521 does not differ in composition from a standard post box of the same design. SCP-521-X refers to the items received during activation of SCP-521, see below for more information.",,,,,,,,
522,Safe,1," SCP-522 appears to be a square swatch of red carpet, approximately 3.5 meters on each side. However, when a human being stands atop it, SCP-522 wraps itself around the victim with surprising speed. Once the victim has been completely enfolded, thousands of hair-like protrusions extend from the surface of the carpet and dig into the victim’s skin, quickly draining them of blood over the next ¦ minutes. After draining the victim’s blood SCP-522 unwraps and attempts to return to its original position, leaving the blanched victim in a heap at its center.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-522/scp-522.png,,,,,,,
523,Euclid,2," SCP-523 does not have a consistent physical form, nor does it have any distinguishing marks by which it can be identified. It does however emit a low-frequency telepathic signal which persons capable of detecting describe as ""a dull ringing sound."" This signal can be used to locate SCP-523 if it ""escapes."" This frequency is also assumed to be the source of SCP-523's ability to short out electronic recording devices such as video cameras and blank out camera film.",,,,,,,,
524,Safe,1," SCP-524 is a common white rabbit, of the species  Oryctolagus cuniculus . It can be identified by its white fur with symmetrical black markings on its body.",,,,,,,,
525,Euclid,2," SCP-525 consists of multiple disjoined arthropod legs, 10-15 cm in length. DNA identification has been inconclusive, but the closest match so far is to the brown recluse spider  Loxosceles reclusa . The base of each leg ends in several minute hooks capable of perforating flesh. SCP-525 is covered in short, fine hairs, and is quite brittle.",,,,,,,,

534,Euclid,2," Although the biological mechanisms behind their support are currently not fully understood, SCP-534 appears to be a collection of several different human blood cells and cell fragments that have increased in size several hundred times. The components of SCP-534 have been placed into three different classifications: SCP-534-1: erythrocytes, SCP-534-2: neutrophils, and SCP-534-3: thrombocytes. All samples of SCP-534 appear to have the ability to survive while ""floating"" in the air, and are affected by air currents. All concentrations of cells appear to match normal blood, with SCP-534-1 comprising approximately 97% of SCP-534. No instances of SCP-534 require nutrients.",,,,,,,,
535,Euclid,2," SCP-535 appears to be an ordinary 250mL borosilicate glass laboratory beaker. It was recovered from an abandoned storage facility in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, USA. SCP-535's origin has been traced to a glassware factory in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ owned by the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ Corporation.

537,Safe,1," Recovered from a pawn shop, to which it had reportedly been brought by a young man in February of 198¦.",,,,,,,,
538,Euclid,2," SCP-538 appears to be animate shadows of an unknown species of spiders. SCP-538 appears to ""feed"" off of the shadows of other living objects, and will move to the nearest shadow cast by a living organism. To ""feed"", SCP-538 does no more than attach itself to the shadow of its host in such a manner that its own shadow is not obscured. Through this manner, a single specimen of SCP-538 can grow up to approximately 15 square centimeters in size. Feeding after this point appears to simply maintain this size; the whole process has so far proven to be harmless to the host. While a specimen can attach itself to an inanimate object to feed, it will slowly atrophy and decrease in size over time. Only when connected to the shadow of a living organism can SCP-538 thrive.",,,,,,,,
539,Euclid,2," Object is a thin, round disc composed of an undetermined material. While there appears to be corrosion around the edges, testing has determined that the marks are not the result of oxidation. When thrown, an event will occur in the immediate vicinity that will draw attention away from its thrower. These distractions have no observable pattern of any sort. However, it has been determined that the distraction will be more overwhelming in proportion to the difficulty of removing attention from the user. Due to the unpredictable nature of SCP-539's effect, testers are currently advised to throw it as far as possible from themselves.",,,,,,,,
540,Safe,1," SCP-540 denotes a collection of Soviet-era explosive ordnance of various makes. All instances can be detonated in the same manner as non-anomalous examples, and explode with a similar yield and blast effect. However, approximately 35-37 seconds following the detonation, a mass of plant life will rapidly grow to cover the majority of the damaged area 1 . The initial growth rate of the plant life is positively correlated to the yield of the originating explosive, but returns to normal for the plant species after approximately 90 seconds. There are currently ¦¦¦¦¦ instances of SCP-540 in Foundation possession and an unknown number outside of Foundation control.",,,,,,,,
541,,6," SCP-541 was discovered in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, Peru in 1988, in the crypt of a local Catholic Mission. The mission had been repurposed for several decades, and at the time of SCP-541's discovery was being converted into a youth hostel. The crypt beneath was being cleared for storage, with the corpses within being reburied locally. SCP-541 was discovered when the workers moving the coffin containing SCP-541 noticed ""wet noises"" coming from within. Investigation revealed SCP-541, led to local hysteria, then a brief fanatical following of SCP-541 (believing it to be supernatural or possibly saintly, akin to incorruptibility). The resultant attention led to a cursory investigation by our agents, followed by a total media blackout, confiscation of SCP-541, and extermination of those close to the object.",,,,,,,,
542,Euclid,2," SCP-542 claims that it has been, at one time, a typical human of Caucasian descent, identifying as German in nationality. This story is supported by the fact that German appears to be his first language, speaking all other languages with a German accent. SCP-542 requests to be called ""Herr Chirurg"" or ""Surgeon"" by staff and is fluent in German, English, and French, and can speak a small bit of Polish and Italian. Standard IQ tests have revealed 542's IQ to range around 150, placing him as high intelligence. It is unknown how old 542 is; testing of various tissue samples has revealed nothing. He claims to have been 'dreadfully normal' before World War I started, and claims to have worked for the Nazi party, even if he found their goals 'boringly simple.'",,,,,,,,
543,Euclid,2, SCP-543 is a collection of ¦¦¦¦ 4-hour VHS videotapes from various manufacturers. Total length of tape is ¦¦¦¦ hours. Tapes are labeled with dates and times from ¦¦/¦¦/¦¦¦¦ to ¦¦/¦¦/¦¦¦¦.,https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-543/tvnoise.jpg,,,,,,,
544,,5," SCP-544 is a 30 cm tall hand-held radio microphone, made of polished metal and black plastic. There is no evidence of wires or electrical plugs of any kind on the object. The object's surface reveals significant but superficial damage (presumably from everyday use). When jostled, the sound of a non-metallic object can be heard inside the device. Requests to disassemble SCP-544 to identify this object have been denied.",,,,,,,,
545,Euclid,2, SCP-545 may be determined as three separate parts.,,,,,,,,
546,Safe,1," SCP-546 consists of a single pad of spiral-bound, lined, ¦¦¦¦ brand note paper. SCP-546 measures 15 cm x 23 cm, and currently consists of 57 sheets out of the original 60. Besides its anomalous effects, the item has no other outstanding characteristics.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-546/546.jpg,,,,,,,

On the reverse, the phrase “Je pense donc…?” is written in black ball-point pen. The modified side of SCP-547 is a cognitohazard and should be treated with the relevant precautions.",,,,,,,,
548,Euclid,2," SCP-548 is a female cobalt tarantula ( Cyriopagopus lividus ), 7.3 cm long. Its venom undergoes a highly endothermic reaction on contact with living tissue; a single bite, injecting less than 0.5 mL venom, causes an average temperature drop of 38°C in the affected area. One bite is sufficient to cause localized frostbite in a human, and may even be lethal should the venom reach the central circulatory system. Victims smaller than SCP-548 are frequently frozen solid.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-548/scp-548.jpg,,,,,,,
549,Euclid,2," SCP-549 appears to be a miniature version of  Ursus arctos horribilis  or grizzly bear. In stature it is approximately 17 centimeters in length when standing on its hind legs. However, SCP-549 has a mass in line with an average adult grizzly bear (in summer around 305 kilograms). It consumes as much food as a full-sized grizzly would and is able to exert all the same force with its claws and bite. This presents a number of problems, since its strength is concentrated over a much smaller area. Several of SCP-549's first enclosures were destroyed because it exerted far more force than expected of so small a creature. The walls of its current enclosure, treated with [DATA EXPUNGED], have proven more able to resist any attempts to escape, though as long as it is fed regularly and not provoked it seems content to remain in the terrarium.",,,,,,,,
550,Euclid,2," SCP-550 is a humanoid composed of wood shavings from  Fraxinus excelsior  (European Ash), measuring 2.1 meters in height and 70 kg in weight. SCP-550 closely resembles a human male suffering from advanced muscle atrophy, though it lacks all exterior and bodily organs. SCP-550 is mainly compliant to human subjects, though it is restricted to following simple commands. Conversation through alternative systems of communication has been unsuccessful in determining if SCP-550 is sapient. SCP-550 is able to smell despite the lack of any sensory organs, and does this solely for the purpose of locating human corpses.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-550/SCP-550.jpg,,,,,,,
551,Safe,1," SCP-551 is a standard, five hundred and fifty (550) piece jigsaw puzzle, which should depict, in its finished form, the image of a solitary woman on a small rowboat, surrounded by a stormy sea. However, due to the nature of SCP-551's anomalous qualities, some details of the scene are left incomplete, such as the woman’s face and [DATA EXPUNGED].",,,,,,,,
552,Safe,1," SCP-552 is a middle-aged human male. The subject’s sensory systems display an anomalous temporal distortion: it cannot perceive its surroundings as they currently are, but only as they will be in the near future. SCP-552 is otherwise physically unremarkable. The subject's physical form can be interacted with normally, but its reactions to any interaction will have already occurred. It is fully cognizant of its condition, and will sometimes attempt to time its reactions to interact normally with researchers.",,,,,,,,
553,Safe,1," SCP-553 is a colony of approximately 140,000 winged organisms superficially resembling butterflies. They possess a silicon-based biochemistry and are composed primarily of calcium and silicate compounds. The body of a member of the species is mostly calcite, with some of the internal organs composed of a material similar to quartz with piezoelectric properties. This silicate impurity adds rigidity to the creature, giving it a rating from 3.5 to 4.5 on the Mohs Hardness Scale. Although they continue to grow throughout their observed lifespan, the growth rate slows considerably once they have entered their adult stage. The average observed wingspan of an adult is 2.3 cm.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-553/butterfly(1).jpg,,,,,,,
554,Euclid,2," SCP-554 is a structure located on Culver Down, Isle of Wight, England. Its date of construction and original purpose are unclear, but photographs taken from the nearby ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ Holiday Park date its presence to the late 1970s.",,,,,,,,
555,Euclid,2," SCP-555 is a metal cylinder with rounded ends, 1.25 centimeters in diameter and 8 centimeters long, similar to a magnet commonly fed to cattle to prevent hardware disease. It emits a field of unknown nature which exerts an attractive force on dead or necrotic human tissue, including hair separated from the body, corpses, shed skin cells, and — in extreme cases — the epidermal layer of the skin. This field does not tend to follow the inverse-square law and does not interact with matter or electromagnetic fields in a manner consistent with any known force. The SCP itself appears to be impervious to force, showing no response to focused heating, compression, or striking.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-555/1280px-CowMagnet.jpg,,,,,,,
556,Euclid,2," SCP-556 is the recovered wreckage of Varig cargo flight PP-VLU, a Boeing 707-323C that crashed approximately 320 km east-northeast of Tokyo, Japan on January 30, 1979. At the time, the aircraft was carrying 153 paintings when a Foundation listening post picked up an anomalous Mayday signal from the flight. Officially, the aircraft disappeared without a trace and no wreckage was ever recovered. Foundation assets were able to recover SCP-556 mostly intact at a depth of ¦¦¦ meters on ¦/¦/1979 and transported the wreckage to Site ¦¦, where it remains today.",,,,,,,,
557,Euclid,2," SCP-557 is an Umm an-Nar era tomb estimated to have been built ca. 2400 BCE, on a gravel plain in the “Empty Quarter” of Northwestern Oman.

SCP-557 was discovered in 1988, during an inquiry into the disappearance of a geological survey team in the area.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-557/SCP-557.jpg,,,,,,,
558,Safe,1," SCP-558 includes a number of different types of colored contact lenses, divided by researchers into five categories by apparent properties. Currently there are ten (10) of each contact lens in categories One through Four (1-4), and six (6) contact lenses of group Five (5). Whereas normal contact lenses are fitted to a particular wearer's eye shape by diameter and curvature, each individual lens in SCP-558 seems to be able to conform to any eye shape. Testing is currently underway to determine the composition of the material without damaging the lenses. In their resting state they have been observed to have a 10mm diameter and 8.7mm base curve radius. Subjects using the lenses with prescriptions requiring different dimensions reported initial discomfort, then a tingling feeling as the lenses adjusted to the shape of their eyes. Rather than standard clear, each lens has a colored central portion slightly wider than the average human iris. The colors are Red, Violet, Green, Gray, and Black. These colors seem to correspond to distinct properties, though all lenses appear to correct vision to 20/20, regardless of subjects' actual vision quality. How this occurs is currently unknown, though testing is ongoing. SCP-558 was found in a toiletries case in the bathroom of room ¦¦¦ of the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ hotel, during a raid called in to investigate reports of [DATA EXPUNGED]. The saline solution found accompanying SCP-558 was determined to be normal, so any standard solution may be used. No other extraordinary items were found in the bathroom.",,,,,,,,
559,Euclid,2," As of the time of writing, SCP-559 is a round vanilla birthday cake. However, its powers have been observed to exist in other baked items like rolls, puffs or cupcakes. Whichever item SCP-559 has subverted in this manner is easily identified by the words ""Birthday Time!"" marked out in green icing. Materials testing has returned this icing to be regular green icing with no unusual traits.",,,,,,,,
560,Safe,1," SCP-560 is a single digital lifeform of indeterminate origin. Viewed through a binary or hex editor, SCP-560 appears as a pattern of bits which travels through the data structure of the storage medium it occupies.

561,Euclid,2," Although SCP-561 itself is unseen, evidence of animal remains in the area suggest that it has been in place since at least 20¦¦. SCP-561 has so far proven to be directly undetectable, producing no electromagnetic or gravitational anomalies. Due to this, SCP-561's exact area of effect is unknown. A rough guess of its boundaries has been extrapolated from the appearance of its products. SCP-561 changes the reproductive results of nearly all living things within its radius, causing them to produce offspring from species extant in the Pliocene epoch, the time period just before the most recent ice age. This effect extends to plants and animals alike, including humans. It should be said that the area around SCP-561 is not yet noticeably different from most other North American forested areas. The flora show slight alterations only, due to the long generation time of larger plants. The area's fauna show a steady increase in alteration as time goes on. At this time any animal life conceived in the radius of SCP-561 has a fair chance of producing Pliocene-era offspring.",,,,,,,,
562,Euclid,2," SCP-562 is the designation for a phenomenon sporadically occurring on internet chat sites. During SCP-562 events, a user is contacted by an entity most frequently identifying itself as “Sylvia Gateman”, “Tom Hedge”, or “Dick O’Dale”.

565,Safe,1," SCP-565 is an ambulatory human head, apparently male, which appears to mimic the behavioral patterns of  Carpilius convexus , a species of coral crab. Its chief method of ambulation is the manipulation of tendrils of unfurled brain matter which emanate from a large crush wound at the back of its skull. These tendrils are often utilized as 'legs', allowing SCP-565 to scuttle along the seafloor like a crab, but occasionally are operated for motion and manipulation in a manner similar to the tentacles of an octopus or jellyfish.",,,,,,,,
566,,6," SCP-566 refers to a set of tear-off desk calendars, sold under the name ""Word-A-Day 2009 Edition: Wacky Wordables and Idiosyncratic Idioms"", with manufacturer listed as ""Living Language Linguists' League"". 1  The front page, where present, includes a black-and-white logo, consisting of a stylized tongue in a top-hat, raising a champagne glass in one hand, and holding a book in the other.",,,,,,,,
567,Euclid,2," SCP-567 is located in the dungeon beneath Site-41, located in [DATA EXPUNGED]. It consists of a series of eight cells, designated SCP-567-1 through SCP-567-8. With the majority of people/objects, the cells remain inert. However, when individuals meeting certain conditions come within 2.5 m of a cell door, shackles will materialize and launch from the inside of the cell, restraining the subject and dragging them within. Once the cell door closes and locks, both the subject and shackles vanish, leaving behind no trace of any kind. Each cell appears to have its own unique trigger conditions in order to activate, which seem to involve committing some sort of criminal or heretical act. 1",,,,,,,,
568,Safe,1," SCP-568 has the appearance of a flexible white strap, 70x8x0.2 cm. An unbroken seam on one side runs down its length, precisely along the center.

569,Euclid,2," SCP-569 appear to be a collection of 46 animate, disembodied, floating human heads. All instances are identical, resembling a bald man in his late 40s. Analysis reveals that SCP-569 are sculpted from Sylacauga marble; no further anomalous materials are present.",,,,,,,,
570,Archon,6," SCP-570 is the collective designation for the densest concentration of thaumaturgical residue currently known to the Foundation. SCP-570 is theorized to have formed at some point around 1999, although its origins can be traced back to 1975 at the earliest. It is currently believed that SCP-570 is the result of an unsustainable number of rituals conducted by The Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo over the span of a decade.",,,,,,,,

Structurally similar to the herpes simplex family of viruses, SCP-584 spreads via direct person-to-person contact and through contact with infected bodily fluids, and can also cross the placental barrier from an infected mother to her fetus, resulting in characteristic birth defects. SCP-584 typically lies dormant deep in the dermal tissue of those infected, largely suppressed by the immune system except for sporadic outbreaks. It is estimated that upwards of 80% of those exposed to the virus are asymptomatic carriers, making actual infection rates unknowable. (Current estimates place the highest rates of infection in Asia, particularly India and China, where the virus likely originated.) The virus appears limited to humans.",,,,,,,,
585,Safe,1," SCP-585-2-4 are small, two-hole pencil sharpeners made of brightly-coloured plastic. ‘The Factory’ is printed in slightly raised text on the undersides. Any pencil inserted into the small hole of SCP-585 and turned clockwise will be sharpened, as is normal for a pencil sharpener. However, with each rotation the ‘sharpness’ of the pencil’s point continues to increase without any apparent limit. Any pencil sharpened by SCP-585’s small hole that is then inserted into the larger hole and turned counter-clockwise is ‘unsharpened’ with each rotation undoing the effect of one previous rotation in the small hole. (Only the shape of the pencil is changed — lost mass from shavings is not restored.) The tip of affected pencils can be broken off, but the point will retain its sharpness and remain dangerous.",,,,,,,,
586,Scarf,4," SCP-586 is a smelt metallic object, pale green in color. The anomalous profession of the object was discovered by accident. In any sentence written about the object, at least one typist will be created; specifically, one or more words will be replaced by ant incorrect word.",http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-586/greenpope,,,,,,,
587,Safe,1," SCP-587 is an HO scale (1:87) model railroad diorama with dimensions 21.3 x 36.5 m. The handcrafted scenery depicts forested hills interspersed with buildings, a railroad, and other models which constitute the fictional township of Red Elk, Colorado. Each model is fully functional; plumbing and electrical power work, cars run on gasoline, etc. The town is populated by 1,270 living individuals identical to human beings other than their 19.5 mm height (average). Physical laws in the vicinity of SCP-587 seem to be altered sufficiently that anticipated ramifications of squared/cubed relationships are not observed.",,,,,,,,
588,Safe,1," SCP-588 is an American twenty-five cent piece (25¢) minted in 1972. Analysis of the chemical composition of SCP-588 has confirmed that it is a standard 91.67%-8.33% alloy of copper and nickel. The depiction of American President George Washington on the obverse side of the coin displays activity consistent with being “alive.” Despite being bound to the plane of the coin face, the head of Washington has a full 180° range of horizontal movement and a vertical range of approximately 90°.",,,,,,,,
589,Keter,3," SCP-589 is a stuffed animal that is able to change its appearance based on the subjective desires of the first person to come in contact with it. SCP-589 has the ability to create a calming, soothing sensation within anybody who sees or comes into physical contact with it. This ability appears to be memetic, as it is able to spread via copies of itself as well as pictures depicting its likeness. However, the effectiveness of these copies is directly proportional to the quality of the product. The calming effect SCP-589 imparts is not unlike the use of narcotics, as it stimulates the areas of the brain that are responsible for feelings of relief and euphoria, and encourages the production of chemicals and hormones that reduce stress. However, this effect quickly becomes addictive, with infected individuals becoming completely dependent on SCP-589 after extended exposure. Once addicted, an individual's interaction with SCP-589 or any of its copies borders on complete obsession, and they are compelled to create more copies of SCP-589 and attempt to spread them.",,,,,,,,
590,Safe,1," SCP-590 appears to be a young male, approximately 16 years of age. The only benefit he receives from his powers is apparent longevity, as he has not aged since his arrival at the Foundation.",,,,,,,,
591,Euclid,2," SCP-591 refers to a line of video game consoles originally developed as a counterfeit of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). SCP-591 was labeled as Pretendo in 1985 and manufactured in Southeast Asia. Official records indicate that the Pretendo brand was bought by another company, Doctor Wondertainment, supposedly to establish themselves in the growing video game market.",,,,,,,,
592,Euclid,2," SCP-592 is a large hardcover book which exhibits no external qualities that could be considered unusual, but which can cause delusions, psychosis, changes in physical health and appearance, or even severe wounding when read. It is titled ""Chronicle of the 20th Century"" and consists of 450 all-color printed pages. It is reported that it has a printed cover (no dust jacket) with the title of the book, the publisher, and a selection of illustrations from within the text. The original cover is a deep blue. The spine contains the title and publisher name, and is left uncovered by tape. The cover page informs the reader that it was published by Interworld Press, 54 ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ St, Chicago, IL in 1996. A company named Interworld Press has never been registered in the US nor does the street listed exist.",,,,,,,,
593,Euclid,2," SCP-593 is a paramyxovirus of the genus  Morbillivirus  that exhibits a unique capacity for severe neurological damage after the onset of primary symptoms. The majority of its genome is identical to that of the measles virus, with a significant percentage of genetic material apparently derived from rinderpest virus (aka 'cattle plague' or 'steppe murrain'). Its contagion rate is equal to that of measles- ninety percent of individuals without immunity who share a household with an SCP-593 morbillivirus patient will develop the infection themselves within thirty days. Initial stages of infection are virtually identical to measles, beginning with a fever that may reach as high as 41° C. Koplik's spots appear on the victim's buccal and lingual mucosae early in the infection; unlike standard measles infections, however, the spots remain visible for two to three days.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-593/measles%20mouth.png,,,,,,,
594,Euclid,2," Discovered in the Altai Mountains during a routine fact-finding mission, SCP-594 is a flock of feral sheep of an unknown breed resembling a wild Argali sheep in general build with a thick fleece like that of a domestic Merino, around 135 cm at the shoulder and weighing 195 kg on average. Gestation and reproductive cycles are similar to most domesticated sheep, with ewes reaching sexual maturity at six to eight months of age and rams at four to six months. They enter a rut twice annually, typically in late spring and early autumn, but breeding can occur year round. Most ewes give birth to a single lamb or twins, with triplets being exceedingly rare (2% of all recorded births to date). Only documented case of triplets which survived to full maturity is 594-01 and his siblings, 594-02 and 594-03. General coloration ranges from pure white to dark blue-gray wool with a metallic sheen appearing once they’ve reached full maturity, typically 2 years of age. Only three animals, the aforementioned triplets, display atypical wool colors. Both sexes have horns, with uncastrated males having spiraling horns measuring 190 cm in length, the largest documented span belonging to 594-02 at a length of 247.4 cm. Females and wethers have curved horns measuring 20 cm. The horns, hooves, and wool of older animals have unusually high concentrations of ferrous metals, along with traces of gold alloys. Examinations of newly butchered animals have revealed that SCP-594’s skeleton also has large amounts of ferrous metals present within the bone matrix.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-594/3071230033_18d0a015a6.jpg,,,,,,,
595,Euclid,2," SCP-595 is a Cannon class destroyer escort, DE-¦¦ USS ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, commissioned by the United States Navy in late 1942. It is no different from any other vessel of its class with the exception of several munitions magazines filled with [DATA EXPUNGED] of unknown manufacture.

596,Safe,1," SCP-596 is a 63cm high bronze snake statue, believed to be a representation of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦. SCP-596 was recovered from a hospital in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ in the hands of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦-¦¦¦¦¦, suspected by local authorities of being a tomb robber. While the implications are clear, the original location of SCP-596 is still unknown.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-596/SCP-596_Snake_Statue.jpg,,,,,,,
597,Euclid,2," SCP-597 is a blob of flesh approximately 5.8m (19ft) high, and 10.67m (35ft) wide, although this measurement changes slightly when it moves, or the substances expand and ripple. All over its body, mostly located on its rolls, are hundreds and hundreds of teats, of various colors and sizes. Whenever a mammal is released into its cell, it will be drawn to the corresponding teat for its species and then proceed to suckle as long as they are unimpeded. The milk released will be identical in every way to the makeup of the subject's mother's, although able to sustain the subject's nutritional needs indefinitely. While the fluid is the same as normal milk chemically, for some reason, whether it be an effect of the SCP or an unknown quality of the substances it excretes, any full-grown mammal that would normally require more can survive to the end of their normal lifespan give or take a few years, simply by suckling at the nipple, although their teeth will fall out, their muscle will atrophy due to lack of use (the subjects will curl up as close as possible on the side, lay under the SCP [there have been reports of suffocation], or immerse themselves and dive into the flesh itself) and stomach problems are presented because of the all-liquid diet.",,,,,,,,
598,Safe,1," SCP-598 is an intelligent shade of yellow covering the whole of the inside of its cell. Attempts to reproduce SCP-598 with paints, crayons, etc., have failed. Through experimentation, SCP-598's properties have been discovered not to be tint or shade dependent (different shades of light, except for total darkness, will not affect the item's sentience) but are hue-dependent (a colored filter placed over the item's light source will cancel the effect).",,,,,,,,
599,Euclid,2," SCP-599 is a small city located in [DATA EXPUNGED] with a population of approximately 700. The inhabitants of SCP-599 refer to it as ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦. SCP-599 does not appear on any map of the region, nor do any of the roads leading to it.",,,,,,,,
600,Safe,1," SCP-600 is a humanoid entity, approximately 1.7 meters tall, with a build approximating an adult human male of average weight for its height. The subject is generally featureless, lacking facial features, external ears, nails, body hair, genitalia, and anus. Full-body scans have shown SCP-600 to have no internal structures of any kind, instead being formed from an unknown material of uniform density close to that of human muscle tissue. It neither ingests, respirates, nor excretes. The subject's age has not been determined.",,,,,,,,
601,Euclid,2," SCP-601 is a group of 12 adult humans of varying age, gender, and ethnicity. The constituent members of SCP-601 perform all actions and bodily functions in unison in as much as is physically and anatomically possible, with no more than 0.15 seconds of delay between any two members of the collective. The source of this synchronization is unclear; no means of relaying nervous system responses between the twelve components of SCP-601 has been observed. Moreover, fMRI and EEG readings of SCP-601-01 through SCP-601-12 suggest zero brain function despite continued (and synchronous) operation of all other organ systems. Proximity appears to be a significant factor in this regard: if any member of SCP-601 is taken farther than 5 meters from the current center of SCP-601, it ceases to be a member of SCP-601 and immediately responds to the effects of total brain death as is typical for a human body. As SCP-601 will typically orient themselves to occupy the smallest space possible for a given activity, such events are rare.",,,,,,,,
602,Safe,1," SCP-602 is an unseen entity that can manipulate objects within Apartment ¦¦¦. SCP-602 can exert enough force to knock people over and hold them down. While SCP-602 appears able to affect objects anywhere within Apt. ¦¦¦, it cannot affect anything outside the apartment if the front door is closed. Thus, SCP-602 can be effectively contained with external locks on Apt. ¦¦¦’s door.",,,,,,,,

604,Safe,1," SCP-604 is a set of tableware and dishes, consisting of 19 plates of various sizes and designs, and 21 goblets, champagne flutes, and other wineglasses. Several are ornately gilded, studded with diamonds and rubies, or made out of fine materials such as porcelain, china, and crystal. Most are extremely heavy, because of the weight of the rich metals. The cutlery, cloth, chairs, table, and other items that made up the banquet where SCP-604 was discovered have no anomalous properties, and are not contained.",,,,,,,,
605,Euclid,2," SCP-605 is a large, amorphous, and airborne gaseous entity visually similar to a high-altitude cloud formation approximately 180 to 260 m in diameter. Its exact appearance varies drastically, from being nearly invisible during its ""dormant"" phase, to resembling an enormous storm front while ""active"". It has been observed to move slowly, but has not left the region bounded by the US state of Florida, Puerto Rico, and Bermuda Island.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-605/scp605-2.png,,,,,,,
606,Euclid (Keter classification under review),6," SCP-606 appears as a spherical mass of light of variable size and intensity. Most commonly, it is approximately 85cm in diameter and emits 220 candelas of luminosity, but has been observed to grow to up to 10m in diameter and emit over 100,000 candelas. SCP-606 has also been observed to shrink to 4cm in diameter, emitting less than 0.5 candela. Despite its ability to emit large amounts of light, SCP-606 emits no heat. It does not appear to be composed of any form of matter, and is able to pass through material barriers effortlessly.",,,,,,,,
607,Euclid,2," SCP-607 is a large grey male American Shorthair cat of indeterminate age with a collar reading ""Dorian"".",,,,,,,,
608,Safe,1," SCP-608 appears to be a length of silver tinsel with an unusually furry appearance, although depending on environment the item may be surrounded by a 'halo' of decaying particles. Any object coming into contact with it disintegrates slowly, the process being halted the instant that it is removed. At the same time, the halo increases in intensity. Microscope examination, radar, sonar, MRI, and all other known examination techniques are unable to provide insight beyond the fact that the object appears 'fuzzy', with no readily defined border. Rather, it appears to dissipate into the surroundings. This, combined with the disintegration property, led to the SCP's earlier misclassification as Euclid.",,,,,,,,
609,Keter,3," SCP-609 is a collection of identical green billiard balls in the American pool style which measure 57.15mm in diameter and are believed to exist only as immaterial manifestations of a concept. Instances of SCP-609, designated SCP-609-1, are unbound by physical laws. Each instance is impervious to damage, undetectable except by the naked eye, and unable to conduct heat; instead, they always feel cold to the touch.",,,,,,,,
610,Keter,3," Initial reports of SCP-610 came direct from the Russian government through undisclosable channels. These reports consisted primarily of disappearances of farmers in the region and were not considered until the local police, followed by the regional police, and finally a government dispatched agent all failed to report in within a 72 hour period. A small military contingent was dispatched to the area and quickly withdrew at which point The Foundation was contacted to investigate.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-610/610-new.png,,,,,,,
611,Euclid,2," SCP-611 was first discovered in ¦¦¦¦¦¦, New Mexico in 20¦¦. A group of tourists recently returning from ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ contacted a local dentist concerning severe tooth and jaw pain. The doctor, discovering the infestation, contacted the Center for Disease Control, at which time the Foundation stepped in and took over. After extracting the larvae from the tourist group, Foundation operatives traced SCP-611 back to the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ restaurant, which had unwittingly played host to them for over a month. Class-A Amnestics were administered to all restaurant employees and all infected patrons that could be located. Most larvae were removed in time, though some had already caused extensive damage. Over ¦¦ deaths caused by subsequent infection were believed to have occurred.",,,,,,,,
,Euclid,2," Instances of SCP-612 present as electrical cables of various types. Any variety of cable can potentially play host to SCP-612, but its preferred method of attack leads it to favor power and network cables.",,,,,,,,
613,Euclid,2," SCP-613 is a piece of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ brand pad paper showing a handwritten recipe for a normal loaf of wheat bread and the words ""WONDER BREAD RECIPE: PLEASE REFER TO THIS PAPER FOR OPTIMUM RESULTS"". There are at present 10 instances of SCP-613 in Foundation custody. All instances of SCP-613 are identical. The recipe is completely identical to other common recipes for regular loaves of wheat bread; however, when a loaf of bread is created by a subject who is only following directions from SCP-613 or memory of it without consulting any other sources, the loaf of bread will become an instance of SCP-613-1.",,,,,,,,
614,Euclid,2," SCP-614 is a website located at the IP address 57.32.¦¦¦.¦¦¦. The IPv4 block 57.0.0.0/8 is owned by SITA and used for telecommunications in the air transport industry.

616,Keter,3," SCP-616 is a prototype Boeing ¦¦¦-¦¦¦, designed by ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ and constructed on 16/06/1966 to specifications. Though superficially similar to the Boeing 737 which went into service shortly afterwards, SCP-616's model had various internal alterations, including [DATA EXPUNGED]. Despite the various alterations, the most important feature of SCP-616 is the center left emergency door, which has been dubbed SCP-616-1. SCP-616-1 is a standard emergency door, though partially covered in extensive markings associated with Satanic cults adhering to [REDACTED]. SCP-616-1 can be opened without major incident when grounded, and leads to the outside of the aircraft as expected. However, this is discouraged as nearly all personnel opening and/or passing through the door have reported severe anxiety problems and a persistent feeling of being watched.",,,,,,,,
617,Euclid,2," SCP-617 has the appearance of a large granite rock, except that it possesses a zipper in its side that is fully operational. When unzipped, SCP-617 is shown to possess a mouth with teeth that appear similar in appearance and construction to human teeth. X-Ray and MRI scans of SCP-617 appear to be unable to penetrate its stone exterior. Similar tests to try and probe SCP-617's internal systems have likewise proven inconclusive. SCP-617's mouth is fully functional, and can vocalize sounds as well as be used to consume food. SCP-617 is also capable of limited movement, being able to roll around under its own power.",,,,,,,,

621,Euclid,2," SCP-621 is a series of highly invasive flowering plants, originally released by ¦¦¦¦¦¦ & ¦¦¦¦¦ Flower Shop, that have been in the Foundation's possession as of ¦/¦¦/0¦. These plants, mainly the plant species Didier’s tulips ( Tulipa gesneriana ), are naturally bioluminescent, powered by water and other nutrients. These plants glow a variety of colors, though most instances glow purple, blue, or green. This bioluminescent effect can be best seen at night or in a dark area. The effect is only active while the plants are alive.",,,,,,,,

SCP-622 was originally marketed as a security aid for large businesses to incapacitate intruders in a similar vein to tear gas or pepper spray. According to ¦¦¦¦¦ Chemical Company, SCP-622 also doubled as a cleaning agent and insecticide, but due to its hazardous nature, ¦¦¦¦¦ Chemical Company was shut down in 19¦¦ before any more products of this nature could be manufactured.

625,Euclid-flecto,5," Instances of SCP-625 are nocturnal organisms composed primarily of distinct sections from no less than seven different species of  Rodentia . They range between 20 and 30 cm in length and, when unfed, weigh between 2.0 and 2.5 kg. When left alone, SCP-625 specimens do not exhibit unusual behavior. They engage in attempts at reproduction, but appear to be infertile.  It is unclear whether this is an effect of being kept in captivity or whether specimens of SCP-625 in the wild are also infertile.  [DATA EXPUNGED]. SCP-625 specimens are omnivorous, and have metabolic requirements comparable to those of other rodents their size. Specimens do not necessarily have a body plan conforming to that of non-anomalous rodents — instances have been located that do not possess bilateral symmetry, as have instances that possess an abnormal number/arrangement of limbs.",,,,,,,,
626,Safe,1," SCP-626 is a metallic structure, approx. 72 cm in height. While SCP-626 appears to be made of some sturdy material, it has very low mass for its volume, possibly indicating that it is hollow. It consists of a base, which rises to a central stem supporting a sphere. The sphere's surface is broken by numerous protrusions, each of which ends in a sphere, in a similar arrangement to the base.",,,,,,,,
627,Safe,1," SCP-627 was brought into the Foundation in December of 1932 by Senior Researcher A¦¦¦¦¦ E¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, fleeing religious persecution in Germany. Senior Researcher E¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ found SCP-627 during his work with the German government on their own SCP protocols, and felt that it could be more useful with us.",,,,,,,,
,,5," Above the soil surface, SCP-628 consists of a copse of 31 large, hollow American sycamore ( Platanus occidentalis ) trees, with trunks from 224 to 455 cm in external diameter. The copse is a colonial organism: below ground, the trees are linked by massive, hollow woody stolons. These ""runner trunks"", which lie roughly 2 m below the soil surface, connect the base of each trunk to between three and seven of its neighbors. An average stolon is 2 m in diameter and completely hollow. Above ground, the trees never produce leaves, flowers, or fruit, although their bark is photosynthetic in summer (as is typical for  P. occidentalis ). The individual trunks are designated SCP-628-1 through -31.",,,,,,,,
629,,6," SCP-629 is a 176 cm tall masculine humanoid made entirely of bronze, styled as a middle-aged man with a beard, button down shirt, tie, jeans, shoes, jacket and beanie. Subtle seams separate SCP-629's body into six component parts — the legs, the arms, the torso, and the head. When SCP-629 was originally recovered, vibrant paints covered its body, but these have since worn off. The words ""Mr. Brass, from Little Misters® by  Dr. Wondertainment 1 "" have been embossed into SCP-629's back. Despite the rigidity of bronze and seeming lack of mechanization, SCP-629 is capable of ambulation and articulation, which often produces mechanical clicking and whirring sounds. SCP-629 is also sapient and capable of speech — which produces CO 2 , water vapor, and trace amounts of lung cells. DNA analysis has found no known matches, but samples variably contain six distinct genetic signatures, belonging to two biological females and four males. Three of these signatures have been found to contain genetic diseases with high infant mortality rates.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-629/brassman.jfif/medium.jpg,,,,,,,
630,Euclid,2," SCP-630 is a 130 meter wide underground glacier and, according to surface sonar scans, at least 12 km long, moving at an estimated 30 meters a year. It is composed of what is theorized to be a mixture of water-ice, which is an opaque black and does not reflect any form of visible light or electromagnetic radiation. The leading edge of the glacier is fragile enough to take samples from; however, they have been shown to withstand ambient temperatures of over 1500°C without melting. Temperature probes indicate that the glacier is cooled to about -10°C, and any significant melting can only be achieved by a sustained exothermic reaction with the water molecules within the ice. When melted, SCP-630 reverts to ordinary, slightly impure water and displays a normal reflection/absorption spectrum. Any sources of water exposed to SCP-630 crystallize, forming ice which behaves for all intents and purposes as part of the original glacier. When samples are placed in contact with naturally occurring ice, no change is recorded in either sample. Research is ongoing into an emergency cryogenic containment protocol in the event that any SCP-630 affected materials are ever introduced to an unsecured body of water.",,,,,,,,
631,Keter,3, SCP-631 is a species of large predatory organism with a vaguely crustacean appearance. They possess a wing morphology consistent with the order  Chiroptera  and a reptilian tail terminating in a venomous stinger.

632,Euclid,2," SCP-632 is a type of arachnid that reproduces via unconventional means. Mature instances measure 10-15mm in length and are highly social, living in colonies numbering up to 500 individuals. While the exoskeleton of SCP-632 instances is composed of a substance resembling calcified fat, the interior is almost entirely derived from differentiated human brain tissue. SCP-632 is unusual among arachnid species in that both male and female SCP-632 are physiologically similar; sexual organs of both appear to be merely vestigial, likely as a result of its reproductive methods.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-632/spodernew.jpg,,,,,,,
,,5," SCP-633 is a supernatural phenomenon resembling a computer virus, first documented in August 1976 by the Homebrew Computer Club. Any device which has interfaced with SCP-633 will permanently become a vector for infection down to the constituent components.

634,Euclid,2," SCP-634 has the appearance of a male common goldfish ( Carassius auratus ) of full maturity, approximately 7 cm in length. SCP-634 was discovered in 20¦¦ in ¦¦¦¦¦, CT. It was housed in a 2 gallon round glass tank placed on the passenger's seat of a car. SCP-634 came to the Foundation's attention when a waitress in a nearby diner noticed that the car had been parked with its emergency lights on for several hours, apparently out of gasoline, with a driver who attempted to start the car approximately once every 90 seconds. She also reported that the officer sent to investigate it had been repeating his walk from his police car to the disabled car and back for more than an hour.",,,,,,,,
635,Euclid,2," SCP-635-1 is a set of ¦¦ illuminated manuscripts dating from the 13th Century recovered by Doctor H¦¦¦¦ S¦¦¦¦ of ¦¦¦¦¦¦ University from the ruins of the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ Monastery in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, Ireland, in August of 18¦¦. The manuscripts came into Foundation custody 36 years later in 19¦¦, a decade after Doctor S¦¦¦¦’s dismissal from the University for [DATA EXPUNGED].",,,,,,,,
636,Euclid,2," SCP-636 is a maintenance elevator at the ¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦ Hotel located at [DATA EXPUNGED]. Unlike the other elevators in the building, SCP-636 contains a magnetic card reader, which when used with a specific card key will cause the elevator to move to a third sub-basement beneath the building. According to the building plan, there are only two sub-basements beneath the building, and the owner of the property was not aware of an elevator with magnetic card access.",,,,,,,,
637,Safe,1," SCP-637-2 is an elderly Caucasian woman of approximately sixty-five (65) years of age, who calls herself “Margie”. “Margie” has been described by staff as “polite and old lady-ish, if a little confused"". She spends much of her time in a semi-catatonic state with occasional lapses of lucidity. SCP-637-2 is the host of SCP-637, a psychic organism which subsists entirely in SCP-637-2’s mind. SCP-637 is described by its host as “a little black cat, skinny fellow, real easy-going”. Although the creature normally resides in a “blank space” in a subject’s mind, it is capable of residing for several minutes as a drawn item on paper, wood, or other substance. If any sapient organism not previously carrying SCP-637 sees the reproduction, the image will vanish, and SCP-637 will take up residence in the new subject’s mind.",,,,,,,,

639,Safe,1," SCP-639 is a Caucasian male approximately 1.6 m in height and weighing 78 kg, age 24. SCP-639 is viewed simultaneously on all angles regardless of viewer's position: being in front of the figure will have a view of his front, back, sides, and so forth. Attempts to capture the subject in any sort of photographic medium yields a heavily distorted figure.",,,,,,,,
640,Euclid,2," SCP-640 is a free-roaming sentient electromagnetic phenomenon, typically manifesting as several roughly circular spots of yellow-orange light, between 18 and 57 mm in diameter depending on the entity's current appetite and energy level. It has also been observed to manifest as spots of infrared and EHF radiation, and seems capable of rapidly varying its wavelength.",http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-640/scp-640-large.jpg,,,,,,,
641,Safe,1," SCP-641 is a seemingly ordinary set of Russian  matryoshka  dolls, but each layer is improbably thin. 1,347 layers of the doll were measured and demonstrated a mean thickness of .04 micrometers with a standard deviation of .02 micrometers. If the disassembled dolls are left untouched for a length of time (ranging from five to seven minutes) the dolls will animate and begin to reassemble- the largest doll 'leaping' over the next largest until the doll is assembled at an extremely rapid rate. The longest time this phenomenon has been observed is three minutes and forty-six seconds, the doll reassembling itself from 3,228 separate pieces. Subjects disassembling the dolls show a marked aversion to leaving the dolls alone, and if compelled to do so will become angry, physically fighting any restraints until the dolls begin to reassemble, at which point attempts to reach the doll cease and the subject typically turns on those responsible for restraints, shouting obscenities until tranquilized. Subjects utilizing the doll show a single-minded interest in disassembly, and will not be distracted without an interruption of significant magnitude, threatening the subject's safety or health. Afterwards, the subjects recall disassembling SCP-641, but exhibit nothing more than mild annoyance at most.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-641/EggDoll.jpg,,,,,,,
642,Euclid,2," SCP-642-1 and SCP-642-2 are a pair of geothermal hot springs located in the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦-¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ region of northern Iceland, approximately six kilometers apart. Characterized by extremely high flow rate (160 liters/second at SCP-642-1, 165 liters/second at SCP-642-2), water emerges at both sites at temperatures varying between 45 and 57 °C depending on the time of year. The sites are geographically remote and inconveniently situated relative to the majority of the island's population centers. They came to Foundation attention in 20¦¦ during the ¦¦¦¦¦¦ mass genomic decoding project. Foundation agents were dispatched to the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ valley to investigate anomalous data and the ¦¦¦¦¦¦ study results were first doctored, then sealed.",,,,,,,,
643,,6," SCP-643 is a collection of 79 unmarked chocolate candies with an abnormally low melting point. 1  While refrigerated, SCP-643 possesses no anomalous effects or outward aesthetic differences from normal chocolates.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-643/643.jpg,,,,,,,
644,Euclid,2," SCP-644 is a male humanoid of Italian descent. Visually, SCP-644 appears to be approximately 30 years old. The words ""Mr. Hot, from Little Misters ® by Dr. Wondertainment"" are tattooed on SCP-644's left inner wrist.",,,,,,,,
645,,5," SCP-645 is a large disk of Pavonazzetto marble with a humanoid face carved into it, similar to the famous  Bocca della Verità  carving in the church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin in Rome, Italy. As with the Bocca carving, the mouth and eyes are empty holes; unlike with the Bocca carving, however, subjects who place their hands inside SCP-645's mouth describe it as 'warm' and 'moist'.",,,,,,,,
646,Euclid,2," SCP-646 is a large, translucent grey, bloated creature measuring roughly 5.6 meters in length, weighing between 3400 and 3700 kilograms. At one end of its body is the approximation of a torso, with a prominent ribcage and a wide, round head. Seven sets of three-jointed limbs are located evenly spaced down the front of the body; a long series of udder-like organs are located between these limbs. The body tapers to a blunt point with a cloaca-like orifice, the entire frame heaving and shuddering irregularly. The shadows of various internal organs (lungs, hearts, and a digestive tract) can be seen through SCP-646's flesh. The flesh is quite smooth and malleable, and a clear, harmless mucus constantly oozes from its skin.",,,,,,,,
647,Euclid,2," SCP-647, when observed via video feed, is a cardboard box appropriately sized for a 35-cm CRT-type television. When a live human being (hereafter ""subject"") is within 1.5 meters of the object, SCP-647 will change its dimensions such that the subject can fit inside it easily. If multiple subjects are within 1.5 meters, the dimensions will adjust to be most appealing to the subject with the most disheveled appearance.",,,,,,,,
648,Euclid,2," SCP-648 is a hidden entrance of the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ hedge maze near [DATA EXPUNGED]. Although no official record of this entrance exists, evidence suggests that SCP-648 was incorporated into the hedge maze shortly after its construction.",,,,,,,,
649,Safe,1," SCP-649 is a matchbox from an unidentified brand, with a thirty-two match count. The box is marked with a logo in the shape of a snowflake crystal on the underside that feels cold to the touch.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-649/649-new/medium.jpg,,,,,,,
650,Euclid,2," SCP-650 is a black statue of a stylized humanoid 167cm tall. The statue does not possess hands or facial features: the limbs taper off into rounded points and the head is a smooth surface all around. The default posture while under observation has the statue reaching upwards, head tilted as if facing the sky. Composition of the statue is currently undetermined; materials testing has yielded inconclusive and contradictory results.",,,,,,,,
651,Euclid,2," SCP-651 is a highly contagious, human-infecting viral genus that causes the fusion of soft tissues. Usually first affecting the distal extremities, the effects of SCP-651 can be observed early in the form of webbing of the fingers and toes. SCP-651 spreads to affect the entire body, typically fusing the subject's thighs and cubital fossa, and eventually causing the mouth, ears, eyes, nostrils, and anus to seal completely. Subjects surviving into the late stages of SCP-651 are forced into a fetal position, the forehead eventually fusing with the knees.",,,,,,,,
652,Safe,1, SCP-652 presents as a neutered male dog of the Basset Hound breed; bone growth analysis indicates that subject is approximately three (3) years old. Subject appears to be physically normal beyond four (4) significant abnormalities:,,,,,,,,
653,Safe,1," SCP-653 is a plastic, multi-coloured boomerang measuring 25 centimetres from tip to tip. SCP-653's shape is the typical returning boomerang; however, it is more durable than its makeup would indicate.",,,,,,,,
654,Neutralized (Formerly Keter),6," SCP-654 is a male narwhal ( Monodon monoceros ), visually disparate from others of its species only in that its characteristic spiral tusk has grown in a clockwise helix from the jaw, rather than the counterclockwise helix found in all other examined narwhals to date. SCP-654 is able to emit sudden bursts of electrostatic discharge from the apex of its tusk. The discharge is reminiscent of lightning, and is accompanied by a loud crack of sound. While not particularly accurate, the tusk can be used to direct the discharge.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-654/654.jpg,,,,,,,
655,Euclid,2," SCP-655 is an 18 m x 20 m x 4 m windowless structure within a complex of buildings located approximately 35 km NNE of Kisangani, Democratic Republic of the Congo. This complex was originally known as the Stanleyville Imperial Biology Institute, and was established by Belgian Congo colonial authorities in 1898. The complex housing SCP-655 was coterminous at the time of its establishment with a now-defunct cobalt mine.",,,,,,,,
656,Safe,1," SCP-656 appears to be a board game box labeled “¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦ Home Edition”, where ¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦ is presumably the name of a game show. No such game show is known to have existed, although the host, ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, is an established personality and host of a number of other game shows. SCP-656 was purchased from the ¦¦¦ ¦¦ ¦¦¦ thrift store by Agent ¦¦¦¦¦ while off-duty.",,,,,,,,
657,Safe,1," SCP-657 appears to be a Caucasian male approximately fifty five years of age. SCP-657 is mostly bald, with a small amount of gray hair remaining. 1.75 meters in height, 77 kilograms. Subject prefers to wear three-button business suits, generally charcoal gray or navy blue in color, as well as bowler hats. All medical tests indicate that SCP-657 is an ordinary human male in his fifties of reasonably good health. SCP-657 prefers to be addressed as ""Gustav"" or ""Mr. Nobel"", but will also respond to his SCP designation.",,,,,,,,
658,,6," Each instance of SCP-658 is an autonomous robotic device. Size and weight varies widely; specimens as small as 5 mm, or as large as ¦¦¦ m, have been observed. Bottom half of each specimen contains four spiderlike, highly flexible legs and a single ""eye"". Appearance and structure of upper half is different in every SCP-658.",,,,,,,,
659,,1," SCP-659 is a species of bird, resembling a heron, which displays a modular intelligence. Native to North America, only a single flock of SCP-659 is known, although there have been unconfirmed sightings in Europe (Document 659-¦).  SCP-659 is naturally an ichthyovore, and as such prefers wetland habitats, but it can survive wherever open water exists.  SCP-659 is now known to be able to subsist on any form of meat, although whenever possible it will still consume fish. When an individual specimen is kept isolated from the flock, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary bird. However, when specimens come near each other, each gains the combined intelligence of the group.",,,,,,,,
660,Safe,1," SCP-660 is an irregular earthenware urn roughly 23cm in height and 28cm in diameter, with an opening 20cm in diameter. The composition of SCP-660 is consistent with generic earthenware clays. The interior of SCP-660 is coated with dried mammalian uterine tissue similar to human endometrial lining. DNA testing is inconclusive.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-660/urn.jpg,,,,,,,
661,Safe,1," SCP-661 is a ¦¦-year-old Caucasian male. Clinical tests have determined him to be overweight and in poor health, although he has no underlying health problems. He is to be provided with an annual physical to monitor his condition. SCP-661’s temperament has been frequently described as abrasive and demanding, while Foundation psychological assessment has determined him to be the possessor of a poor temper, which has increasingly worsened since his containment in 199¦.",,,,,,,,
662,Safe,1," SCP-662 is a small silver hand bell, 4 cm tall and 2 cm in circumference. The bell is missing its ringer. Within the inside of the bell, an inscription has been etched into the silver, reading: “Forever Mine – S.J.W.” The bell is susceptible to damage; however, given its safe nature, destruction has been deemed unnecessary. As it is made of very pure silver, it requires regular polishing to remain without tarnish.",,,,,,,,
663,Euclid,2," SCP-663 is a ¦¦¦¦¦ brand water filtration pitcher, albeit lacking a serial number and possessing a slightly narrower top which lacks the hinge present on the typical ¦¦¦¦¦ pitchers. It appears to be capable of filtering any water-bearing solution into clean and drinkable water. Any water produced by SCP-663 is nearly completely deionized, and lacks any distinctive taste. While SCP-663 is in the process of filtering the sound of a faint heartbeat can be heard emanating from the filter core. Additionally, the filtration process releases several joules of thermal energy per gram of filtered solution.",,,,,,,,
664,Euclid,2," SCP-664 is an anomaly affecting the approximate area contained by the third floor of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ High School in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, Pennsylvania, USA. SCP-664 is invisible to all observation and measurement thus far attempted, and is discernible only by its effect on living biological organisms.",,,,,,,,
665,Safe,1," SCP-665 is a human male, age ¦¦. All of this information, including his species, was obtained through an interview. He has refused to provide further information (see addendum). Further physical descriptions cannot be given at this time, as SCP-665’s external appearance changes frequently. Any non-living solid object with a mass less than that of SCP-665 that comes in contact with SCP-665’s body instantly fuses to it. Within one hour, the object will effectively become part of SCP-665’s body, and will affect smaller objects in the same manner. It is worth noting that this means SCP-665's mass increases with each item added; therefore, all personnel are advised against adding any further objects.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-665/scp-665.png,,,,,,,
666,Euclid,2," SCP-666 is a medium-sized Tibetan yurt, made of tied wooden branches and covered in yak leather. The interior ceiling is 2.44m (8ft) high and the base of the yurt is 9.14m (30ft). The hut is circular in shape. The interior of the yurt has a dirt floor and appears to be as crude as the outside to the majority of observers; the branches that make up the yurt frame are wrapped in rabbit fur and tied with yak leather thongs. Periodically, SCP-666 will change its location within the confinement area; this will happen only when not under direct observation, but remote viewing gives the impression of an entity inside the structure lifting it wholly and moving to its new position. To date, it has not made any attempt to escape confinement.",,,,,,,,
667,Keter,3," SCP-667 is a symbiotic pairing consisting of a colony of flowering vines of an unclassified species morphologically similar to  Pueraria lobata  (""kudzu""), designated SCP-667-1, and an unclassified species of flying creatures possessing insectoid and humanoid morphological qualities, designated SCP-667-2. The only known instance of SCP-667 in the world is located in a wilderness area in the southeastern United States, approximately ¦¦ km north of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦, and covered an area of ¦¦ sq km prior to being trimmed to its current size. Forensic analysis of skeletal remains found within SCP-667-1 indicate that it was introduced to the region shortly after the introduction of kudzu to the United States in the late 19th century.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-667/kudzu.jpg,,,,,,,
668,Euclid,2," SCP-668 is a 33cm (13in) chef's knife with a rosewood handle and full-tang construction, crafted at some point from the late 1930s to the early 1940s. When first acquired by field operatives, SCP-668 was in badly rusted condition, with heavy pitting from blood stains and other bodily fluids trapped in micro-crevices within the blade. Following thorough analysis, these irregularities were removed for aesthetic purposes. This has had negligible, if any, effect on SCP-668's special properties.",,,,,,,,
669,Safe,1," SCP-669 is a sphere of radius 2.6cm, resembling a large bearing. When inactive, SCP-669 weighs approximately 560g. The surface of SCP-669 contains numerous sites of corrosion and pitting, as well as remains of a cadmium blue paint. The surface temperature of SCP-669 appears to vary between 32.1 and 33.8 degrees Celsius - this appears independent of the temperature and thermal conductivity of its surroundings.",,,,,,,,
670,Safe,1," SCP-670 is comprised of four roughly humanoid individuals, SCP-670-1, SCP-670-2, SCP-670-3, and SCP-670-4, who refer to themselves collectively as 'the Cotton family'. SCP-670-1 and SCP-670-2 appear to be the 'father' and the 'mother' of the family, judging by their height and comments made in interviews, while SCP-670-3 and SCP-670-4 are the 'children' of the family. Members of SCP-670 possess a thin outer layer of hardened clay 'skin', showing signs of deterioration from over a long length of time.",,,,,,,,
671,Euclid,2," SCP-671 is a large colony of Spanish carpenter ants ( Camponotus cruentatus ), comprising approximately 30,000 individuals. When SCP-671 is faced with a complex artificial device, its constituent individuals will attempt to reduce it to its simplest components. (Organisms, living or dead, do not trigger this behavior.) The ants appear attracted to artificial devices as to food sources. Screws will be unscrewed, staples and nails extracted, etc. In the process, even a single SCP-671 individual is able to exert forces several hundred times greater than a normal  C. cruentatus . When large numbers of ants collaborate, they are capable of surprising feats.",,,,,,,,
672,Euclid,2," SCP-672 is a species of coral that grows in desert environments. The rich green color of SCP-672, making it appear as a plant at first glance, comes from a previously undiscovered but unremarkable species of zooxanthellae. The colony is extremely efficient with resources. Dead individuals are broken down and any useful components redistributed, leaving behind limestone that can only be distinguished from deposits formed by normal coral by the presence of [REDACTED]. When not active, SCP-672 polyps completely seal themselves within their shells and become nearly impossible to distinguish from surrounding rock formations. It is recommended that MTFs carry a copy of Document 672-12 as an identification aid when performing fieldwork relating to SCP-672. Outside of expansion events SCP-672 will periodically become active for brief times to either consume prey or to allow its zooxanthellae to undergo photosynthesis.",,,,,,,,
673,Keter,3," SCP-673 is a mass of organic tissues, connected in what appears to be a totally random assembly. These tissues include recognizable structures, such as hearts, digestive tracts, blood vessels, and brain matter; however, many tissue structures are not identifiable by composition or purpose. Tissue structures are also noted for their increased size, appearing twenty to fifty times as large as their normal counterparts. Sample tests have shown the basic structure of SCP-673 to have no known counterpart among normal organics, and lacks any form of DNA or normal cellular composition.",,,,,,,,
674,Safe,1," SCP-674 is a ""Zapper"" light gun peripheral for the Nintendo Entertainment System, consistent with other models that were bundled with the NES in North America after 1985. SCP-674 displays typical wear and tear and some indication that previous owners tried to pry the casing open unsuccessfully. The device is not indestructible and has responded to stress tests as expected. Disassembling and reassembling the device has revealed no anomalous parts or internal tampering. Cleaning and maintenance of its parts appears to have improved its accuracy but has not removed a blind spot that begins on the extreme right side of any screen it is aimed at.",,,,,,,,
675,Safe,1," SCP-675 is a standard window and frame found in the northwest portion of Observation Post 9010, in the living room area. During random time intervals, shadows resembling humanoid figures (designated as SCP-675-1) can be seen through the window. These shadows are visible at all times of the day and night, and are seen to be visually distinct from normal nighttime darkness. These instances are only visible from within Observation Post 9010. It is currently hypothesized that SCP-675-1 instances are trans-dimensional beings, and that SCP-675 functions similarly to  SCP-1278  and  SCP-1288  as a means of viewing them.",,,,,,,,
676,Euclid,2," SCP-676 is a hot spring and an associated 7 km long stream, located in the hills outside of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦. When it was discovered by the Foundation, the basin of the spring was approximately 2 m wide, but it has since expanded to over 90 m in diameter.",,,,,,,,
677,Safe,1," SCP-677 is a silver, ¦¦¦¦-brand pogo stick that has significantly visible wear. Etched onto the side is an engraving reading “For Mike: Happy Travels!” SCP-677’s frame appears to be indestructible by all normal means, though it can be dismantled. The spring itself, oddly, is easily broken, though it can be replaced with any spring that will fit around the SCP’s shaft. The type of spring used appears to have no effect on SCP-677’s mechanics, so long as it is unbroken.",,,,,,,,
678,Safe,1," SCP-678 is a small statuette of a sleeping angel, that displays no unusual characteristics under visual inspection. Upon unshielded physical contact with SCP-678, however, SCP-678 excises highly traumatic events from the subject's memory immediately, leaving a blank period in the subject's recollections of the past. This function is currently being evaluated for use as a new grade of amnestic, but the further effects of SCP-678 render it unsuitable for use at this time. The process of memory removal utilized by SCP-678 is damaging to the subject, however, and in the week following contact with SCP-678, the subject's mind continues to erode. This erosion does not stop, but reaches a critical point at any time from six to nine days after initial contact when the autonomous capabilities of the brain to regulate heartbeat, breathing, and other homeostatic effects is eradicated. At this point, the subject typically dies of asphyxiation. Autopsy reveals no physical damage to the brain, and the method utilized by SCP-678 is currently unknown. After an event such as this, SCP-678 alters shape, the statuette shifting to a standing position with its eyes open and teeth clenched. The next unshielded contact with SCP-678 will cause the transference of the memories initially erased to the subject currently touching SCP-678, and SCP-678 will revert to its standard form.",,,,,,,,
679,Keter,3," SCP-679 is a fungal infection of a previously unknown  Aspergillus  species. It was discovered among the local homeless population in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, Florida.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-679/scpeyes.png,,,,,,,
680,Safe,1," SCP-680-1 is a slate sculpture in the form of a human skull missing its mandible, with a mass of approximately 7.5 kg. The sculpture itself does not appear to be hollow, as all orifices have been filled with a presently-unknown black substance that rates 9.6 on the Mohs Scale of Mineral Hardness. Beyond its improbably high durability, the skull itself appears to have no particularly unusual properties. Resting on top of SCP-680-1, however, is SCP-680-2.",,,,,,,,
681,Euclid,2," Discovered in a warehouse under investigation for several cases of reported death by suffocation, SCP-681 is roughly two hundred 155-cm canisters of helium gas with unusual properties. In the event of leakage in the vicinity of brainwave producing subjects, it will move towards the subject and fill airways and sinus cavities with helium gas. In enough volume, this can lead to death via suffocation.",,,,,,,,
682,Keter,3," SCP-682 is a large, vaguely reptile-like creature of unknown origin. It appears to be extremely intelligent, and was observed to engage in complex communication with  SCP-079  during their limited time of exposure. SCP-682 appears to have a hatred of all life, which has been expressed in several interviews during containment. (See Addendum 682-B).",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-682/monster8editub9-new.jpg,,,,,,,
683,Euclid,2," SCP-683 consists of two objects: SCP-683-1 and SCP-683-2. When its unique properties are activated, it will produce samples of SCP-683-3.",http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-683/683art,,,,,,,
684,Euclid,2," SCP-684 is a massive object (assumed to be a living creature) found on the seafloor of the Indian Ocean. It is irregular in shape, with the center of its mass located at approximately ¦¦.¦¦, -¦¦¦.¦¦. From that center mass, SCP-684 extends approximately 70 km outward, maintaining an average height above seafloor of 12 m.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-684/motherofpearls.jpg,,,,,,,
685,Euclid,2," SCP-685 is a large pit located in a remote mountain region of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, located at ¦¦'¦¦¦"" S ¦¦'¦¦¦"" E. It is roughly circular, with a mean diameter of 33.5 m, and appears to be a natural opening in the Earth's crust, with no signs of excavation. Roughly once every 2-5 hours, objects are observed rising out of the pit, pausing at a height of ±2 m relative to the rim of the pit before descending back into SCP-685. In the ¦¦ years that SCP-685 has been under observation, no object dropped into the hole has emerged from it again. Descending into the pit presents a danger to any explorer, as the objects have progressively higher velocities the deeper they are observed in the pit. Despite the impossibility of this, this behavior is consistent with objects accelerated solely by gravity through an airless corridor crossing the Earth's extent. However, an investigation of area within a 100km radius of the site opposite SCP-685 revealed no topological anomalies, so even if the pit does descend past the earth's crust, it does not emerge on the other side.",,,,,,,,
686,Safe,1," SCP-686 is an opaque white liquid consisting of a suspension of lipids and proteins that is indistinguishable from ordinary high-grade dairy milk without detailed analysis. At a biochemical level there are certain subtle differences: the protein content is much more complex, with most of the peptides so far proving difficult to sequence, and it contains a richer blend of vitamins and minerals than is typical of cow's milk.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-686/Milk-bottle.jpg,,,,,,,
687,Safe,1," SCP-687-1 is a Commodore 64 home computer built in 198¦, serial number S000¦¦¦¦¦. Non-invasive examination of the hardware confirms that it has not been obviously modified and all parts appear to be from the original manufacturer.",,,,,,,,
688,Euclid,2," SCP-688 is an animate, apparently living, entity that shares many gross morphological similarities with  Ichthyomyzon castaneus  (Chestnut Lamprey). However, it differs in several key respects: SCP-688 has no external sensory organs, gills, or cloacal openings. SCP-688 is also much larger and varies considerably more in size, ranging from 10cm to over 200cm in length. SCP-688 is also found in a more varied habitat, and has been found as far south as [REDACTED] and as far north as [REDACTED], above ground, in burrows, as well as underwater.",,,,,,,,
689,Keter,3," SCP-689 appears to be a small green soapstone statue, 30 cm in height. It is carved in the semblance of what appears to be an unknown deity of the underworld, a seated skeletal figure with hands clasped over knees. It was discovered by ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ during one of the prewar German archaeological expeditions in the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ area of India and obtained after the war by the OSS. Its location during the war is unknown.",,,,,,,,
690,Euclid,2," SCP-690 appears to be a standard box of commercially-available adhesive bandages, now containing forty-seven (47) bandages. The logo on the box states that its contents are ""Anti-Bandages (box of 64) - for the practical joker!"", and that they are supplied by ""your friends at the Factory"".",,,,,,,,
691,Euclid (Reclassification to Safe pending confirmation from Foundation Intelligence that [REDACTED]),6," There are currently fifteen identical instances of SCP-691 that are, or have been, under Foundation control. SCP-691 is a plain blue cassette tape on which is printed ""Pure Escapism-Limited Edition. 1 of only 250!"" One side of the tape contains a short foreword by an unknown male, introducing a piece of music (see addendum SCP-691-A1 for further details). On the opposite side,  Aquarela do Brasil , using S.K. Russel's English lyrics, can be heard. This particular version is played by a modern symphony orchestra with an unidentified lyric tenor providing the vocals.

692,Safe,1," SCP-692 comprises 57 packages of ""Weisser Riese"" washing powder secured by the Foundation from a general store in ¦¦¦¦¦¦, Czech Republic, and several households nearby. All of the packages belong to the ¦¦¦¦/¦¦¦ production series.",,,,,,,,
693,Euclid,2," SCP-693 is a series of 18 cm humanoid dolls, each one made from a single strand of string, with beads of onyx for eyes. Several instances of SCP-693 have varied forms of clothing, from string shirts or pants to cloth headbands and hats. The clothing appears to have no effect on the properties of the doll. New instances of SCP-693 are found with an instruction sheet attached, the contents of which are detailed in Addendum 693/A.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--resized-images/scp-693/thephanthomwriter/medium.jpg,,,,,,,
694,Euclid,2," SCP-694 is an externally observable time loop that has been cycling every 38 minutes since November 23, 2004, in the town of [REDACTED], Vermont. SCP-694 contains the events of an attempted kidnapping and armed pursuit, followed by a car crash in a ravine alongside [REDACTED] road.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-694/snowytown.jpg,,,,,,,
695,Safe,1," SCP-695 appears to be a form of hermaphroditic parasitic eel. SCP-695 has a multiple-stage life cycle that uses human beings as its primary host. Investigation has shown that SCP-695 may be the result of genetic tampering, with several aspects of its physiology, behavior showing evidence of non-natural evolution, and several genetic sequences matching those of  SCP-1238 ,  SCP-1340 , and  SCP-1821 . SCP-695 is capable of sustained survival outside of a host, but will seek out a host whenever possible, appearing to rely primarily on smell and electromagnetic sensitivity.",,,,,,,,
696,Neutralized (formerly Safe),2," SCP-696 is a portable mechanical typewriter. No manufacturer information, serial number, or other identifying features are present on SCP-696.",,,,,,,,
697,Euclid,2," SCP-697 consists of the contents of one-hundred (100) toxic-chemical containment drums, consistent with those used by Duslo a.s. for waste disposal. All are in either perfect or near-perfect condition, and three have yet to be breached by the Foundation or other persons. Each drum is filled to the brim with an as-yet-unidentified chemical.",,,,,,,,
698,Euclid,2," SCP-698 is a jade carving of a turtle. Any person who is within 1 m 45 cm of SCP-698 while making any sort of decision or choice will experience a voice in their head telling them that they have made a mistake and what they should have done instead. However, this statement will only be made after a delay of 5 minutes 25 seconds, and only if they have not left SCP-698's range within that time. In the event that a decision or choice was objectively correct, or the superior choice, no statement will be made.",,,,,,,,
699,Euclid,2," SCP-699 is a clear rectangular case 2.5 m x 1.5 m x 1 m in size. Engraved on one side is the SCP Foundation “Keter” symbol, and “SCP-17591.” The artifact appears to be plexiglass, but is in fact a super-dense polymer much stronger and heavier than any material currently manufactured. The weight of the object is estimated at 24,000 kg. SCP-699 shows no seams in its construction, and no obvious means of opening it. It has resisted all attempts to open, damage, or acquire a sample of the material it is composed of. Attempts to acquire a small sample of the material so that it can be reproduced are ongoing.",,,,,,,,
700,,5," SCP-700 is a large, abandoned building, similar to a factory in design, located in a rural area of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, USA. It contains ¦ floors (one being underground), each containing ¦¦ rooms. Many of these rooms are built in a way that does not appear to serve any specific purpose, containing, for example, redundant machinery, sewage pipes that are not connected to any kind of disposal unit, and numerous power cords extended across the room in a manner similar to sash cords.",,,,,,,,
701,Euclid,2," SCP-701,  The Hanged King's Tragedy , is a Caroline-era revenge tragedy in five acts. Performances of the play are associated with sudden psychotic and suicidal behavior among both observers and participants, as well as the manifestation of a mysterious figure, classified as SCP-701-1. Historical estimates place the number of lives claimed by the play at between ¦¦¦¦¦ and ¦¦¦¦¦ over the past three hundred years.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-701/Volgun701.jpg,,,,,,,
702,Euclid,2," SCP-702 is a simple red vase of unknown design. Human contact with the vase causes an entity (herein referred to as SCP-702-1) to emerge from the vase and initiate contact with the individual coming into contact with SCP-702. The method of detection seems to be thermal in nature, as SCP-702-1 emerges when contact is established through thin, heat-transmitting materials, but does not emerge when contact is established through an insulated material. SCP-702-1 is a sapient gas-based life form that communicates through coordinated vibration of the air around it. A sample has been impossible to gather due to SCP-702-1's tendency to react violently to anyone coming into physical contact with it. Upon emergence, SCP-702-1 greets the subject establishing contact with SCP-702, and attempts to persuade the subject to give it a gift. If the subject refuses, the entity [DATA EXPUNGED] and takes a single object or part from the remains. Some objects are rejected by SCP-702-1, claiming that it ""already has one"", and demands a new gift, returning the offered object. If SCP-702-1 accepts the offered gift, it returns an object of roughly equal value to the subject and disappears. See Experiments 702-001 through 702-004 for a transcript of successful transactions with SCP-702.",,,,,,,,
703,Euclid,2,,https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-703/703-new.jpg,,,,,,,
704,Euclid,2," SCP-704 is a loop of winding road breaking off and reconnecting to State Highway 96 in the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ National Forest. The loop does not appear on any conventional or electronic maps, and satellite surveillance is made difficult by an inability to focus on the affected area.",,,,,,,,
705,Safe,1," SCP-705 is normally contained within a 5 oz container of children’s modeling compound, commonly known as “Play-Doh”. While properly sealed, SCP-705 exhibits no unusual qualities, or anomalous behavior. SCP-705 was originally discovered within the ¦¦¦¦¦¦ Corporation’s research labs in ¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ as part of an attempt to create a “self-molding” product. The means by which this was accomplished is still unknown, but the results led to the abandonment of the line and the labs themselves. Retrieved on ¦-¦¦-¦¦¦¦, SCP-705 was originally moved to Site ¦¦, then relocated a month later to its current location at Site 17.",,,,,,,,
706,Euclid,2," SCP-706 is an adolescent European-American female identified as ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, twelve years of age according to local records at time of initial containment. Records also indicate that SCP-706 had been home-schooled throughout its life and that neighbors rarely saw SCP-706 outdoors.",,,,,,,,
707,Safe,1," SCP-707 is a matryoshka doll, or Russian nesting doll, consisting of one (1) center doll and four (4) separating outer layers. The doll is painted in a primarily blue color palette, and dating of the materials, while inconclusive, shows that it is approximately ¦¦ years old.",,,,,,,,
708,Euclid,2," SCP-708 is an orange Toyota Model 7FDU80 7-Series Forklift with a typical lift capacity of 8 metric tonnes. Records indicate it was purchased by [REDACTED] on 7/13/¦¦¦¦ and delivered 7/30/¦¦¦¦. SCP-708 came to the Foundation's attention when 3 construction workers employed by [REDACTED], while operating the machine, strayed completely from their duties, seeking out objects to lift throughout the city of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, NY. One other construction worker, however, immediately attempted to destroy all members of the crew working at the job site. At this point, the Foundation launched an investigation, and quickly turned to SCP-708 as the culprit, which was proven when Agent ¦¦¦¦¦¦ attempted to move the vehicle onto a Foundation transport, and upon starting the vehicle, attempted to lift the transport, instead.",,,,,,,,
709,Safe,1," SCP-709 is a spherical ""tree house"" assembled from a kit provided by the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ company of Vancouver Island. It has been furnished as a small apartment suitable for overnighting. When a person looks out the window for a period of more than three to five minutes, they will begin to see what appear to be alternative versions of the forest and its inhabitants, such as a ""four-winged bird"" or a range of bipedal cougars walking down a trail. These visions are not consistent between viewing sessions, or between observers during a single session. They can be recorded with conventional video or film equipment, but the equipment will not record the same sights as living observers; neither will different cameras record the same images, even during simultaneous recording sessions.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-709/scp709.jpg,,,,,,,
710,Euclid,2," SCP-710 is an abandoned suburban housing development located in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦. However, any and all organic life that enters SCP-710 will eventually disappear without a trace. Exactly how or why this phenomenon occurs is currently unknown, but video recordings of test subjects have revealed several distinct stages.",,,,,,,,
,,5," Built by the SCP Foundation from plans retrieved [DATA REDACTED], SCP-711 is a device assembled from several highly-modified [DATA REDACTED] high-energy physics equipment. Its primary function [DATA EXPUNGED]: in short, it is capable of sending data into its past and of receiving data from its future. Transmission is strictly one-way. Independent operation of the item is therefore causally impossible: any message it receives will necessarily be sent at some point in its future. All SCP-711 messages predetermine their own existence and content.",,,,,,,,
712,Safe,1," SCP-712 is a pair of colors designated SCP-712-a and SCP-712-b, produced by the light-generating apparatus SCP-712-1. SCP-712-a is described by test subjects as ""reddish green"" and SCP-712-b is described by test subjects as ""yellowish blue."" While prior published research into impossible colors had achieved limited success by projecting one of two component colors into each eye of participants, SCP-712-a and SCP-712-b are each discrete colors. While the colors of SCP-712 can be perceived by human subjects, their wavelengths are expressed as imaginary numbers rather than wavelengths found in the visible spectrum. Specific information can be found in Dr. ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦'s research notes.",,,,,,,,
,,4," SCP-713 is a desktop personal computer running Windows 95. It bears no external manufacturer’s markings, but internal inspection reveals it to be composed entirely of hardware commercially available in the late 1990s. The keyboard and mouse connectors are soldered into their sockets, and there are no ports available for peripherals except the monitor. The computer has no Internet capability. The hard drive contains assorted commercially available software, including [DATA EXPUNGED] office suite, [DATA EXPUNGED] image-editing software, and Solitaire.",,,,,,,,
714,Safe,1," Seemingly nothing more than a green jade ring, SCP-714 has been shown to be able to expand and contract to perfectly fit the finger of anyone who touches it, though this is the least important of its properties. SCP-714 only changes size when touched by a 'new' subject.",http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-714/SCP-714.jpg,,,,,,,
715,,5," SCP-715 is a ""Take Your Own Photo"" fotomat model photo booth manufactured by the Sony corporation in 1972. SCP-715 displays no anomalous characteristics in its design or appearance. A small metal tag has been added to the backside of the machine, but significant wear has obscured any text contained on the tag.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-715/booth.jpg,,,,,,,
716,Euclid,2," SCP-716 is a large locomotive and a variable number of cars, between eight and twenty on average. Both the locomotive and cars appear to be in an advanced state of neglect. Physical damage dealt to SCP-716 appears to slowly “regenerate” over time; however, it maintains an appearance of extreme neglect and rust. SCP-716 can be physically moved with difficulty; however, the locomotive appears to be unable to function normally and appears to be missing many critical parts.",,,,,,,,
717,Euclid,2," SCP-717 is the ruins of a two-story Victorian style home hidden within Site-¦¦, specifically the remains of the guest bedroom on the upper story. Although the walls of the hallway leading to SCP-717 have burnt through, the doorway to the room is to remain closed at all times. Staff are required to knock gently upon the door once for each member of staff present before entering, even for routine maintenance. All other doors within the house have been removed.",,,,,,,,
718,Keter,3," SCP-718 is an eye, roughly the size of a baseball. It is supported by a long, thin stalk made of tendon and blood vessels. It stands 1.22m (4ft) tall, and appears to need no nourishment, nor excrete any waste. The eye will turn and follow any living thing in its field of vision. The stalk is capable of limited movement, and will follow living things for a short distance. SCP-718 will also stare at any observational equipment in its containment area if no living things are present. SCP-718 appears to prefer staring at humans more than other animals.",,,,,,,,
719,Safe,1," SCP-719 is a General Electric “Porta-Color” television (Model #WAHE5223RW) manufactured in 1975. The fixed internal electronics have not been altered from the original design, but all vacuum tubes have been replaced by 8 devices of unknown manufacture, collectively designated as SCP-719-1. Each device appears to be an opaque black cylindrical crystal fitted into a socket conforming to those of standard vacuum tubes. These devices appear non-functional when placed in a standard tube-tester, or individually fitted in another electronic device. The only configuration found that appears operational is when all 8 devices are fitted into the chassis of a General Electric television with the specific electronic configuration of SCP-719. When SCP-719-1 is in place, and SCP-719 is supplied power and turned on, SCP-719-1 will radiate electromagnetic radiation in various spectra including visible light, ultraviolet, microwaves, gamma radiation, and a substantial band in [REDACTED]. About 60% of emissions are ionizing radiation.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-719/SCP.jpg,,,,,,,

721,Safe,1," Each instance of SCP-721 is a steel cylinder painted black measuring 7 cm in diameter and 2 cm in height. One side is covered by a steel mesh, and the other by a weak magnet labeled with ""The Factory"". Testing does not indicate that the material itself has any anomalous properties.",,,,,,,,
722,Keter,3," SCP-722 was found in the eastern glacial ranges of Greenland by Greenpeace activists making a documentary on the effects of global warming. Upon descending into a crevasse that had opened up on the southern end of the Kangerdlugssuaq glacier, they discovered a network of tunnels within the glacier which had long since been smoothed out, eventually reaching a series of larger chambers which seemed to host a tremendous serpentine body. After another hour of exploration the team left the glacier and headed to the nearby town of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦. Within hours most of the team felt symptoms of a wide array of sicknesses resembling everything from swollen lymph nodes to fast necrosis of the skin. By nightfall the entire team was dead. An SCP operative on leave caught wind of the story and sent notification to high command.",,,,,,,,
723,Safe,1," SCP-723 is a spiral stone staircase, hewn from ordinary limestone, contained within a ruined church located in sparsely populated ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, England. The stairs scale the interior of a ruined tower on the structure's eastern side. Each stair is approximately 0.75m (2.5ft) wide, ascending in a clockwise direction at a 42 degree incline. From the exterior, the site appears to be in a state of disrepair, including the tower which SCP-723 ascends; however, this damage is not visible from the interior of the tower, though the staircase is still visibly worn. SCP-723 also appears to extend further upwards than the exterior architecture suggests.",,,,,,,,
724,Safe,1," SCP-724 is an anomaly covering approximately 8 m in diameter, located near the intersection of Interstate ¦¦ and Route ¦ in ¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦. It occurs only when all of the surrounding radio towers (designated SCP-724-A through SCP-724-¦) are broadcasting actively, and when the signals from these towers are able to reach the anomaly's location without significant interference.",,,,,,,,
725,Euclid,2," Subject is a 13.7 m long, 34,800 kg female cetacean with gross anatomical similarities to  Megaptera novaeangliae , or the Humpback whale. It was recovered after causing maritime disruptions in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ Bay. Physically the animal is similar to other humpback whales. Small anatomical differences may indicate it is a subspecies of that organism, or [DATA EXPUNGED].",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-725/humpback.jpg,,,,,,,
726,Euclid,2," SCP-726 are physiologically and genetically identical to the eggs and larvae of  Lucilia sericata , a species of blowfly common worldwide in warm climates. When larvae hatch on decomposing animal matter, they begin to consume nonliving tissues as normal until none remain, at which point they collect at a central point and begin to regurgitate a continuous stream of healthy, living cellular matter, and will multiply in number by unknown means as volume increases. If uninterrupted, SCP-726 will ""reconstruct"" a complete body matching that of the original tissue source. The reconstruction process occurs at high speed, resembling footage of maggot activity in reverse, and ends with the full restoration of life functions as all larvae abruptly drop off and appear to disintegrate.",,,,,,,,
727,Safe,1," SCP-727 resembles a smithy of ancient Greek design. It contains artisans' tools originating from a wide variety of eras and countries, some of which have not yet been identified. The item's walls and ceiling are covered with masses of chains made from a material similar to iron. SCP-727's nature makes these chains' length impossible to measure.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-727/Garden_Triclinium_Petra_Jordan1415.jpg,,,,,,,
728,Safe,1," SCP-728 appears to be a standard shipping container, 12.19 m by 2.44 m by 2.90 m. The exterior is painted red, and shows some signs of weathering. Markings and numbers on the exterior are consistent with the system used by [DATA REDACTED]; however, no such designation has ever been assigned to one of their containers. Analysis of the material used in constructing the container has found it to be made from terrestrial metals, though not in any combination usually associated with the construction of shipping containers.",,,,,,,,
729,Safe,1," SCP-729 is a large bathtub carved from marble. The item's properties were discovered by accident during a police reconstruction of a suspected murder-suicide in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦; it was retrieved by an undercover Foundation agent soon after.",,,,,,,,
730,Euclid,2," SCP-730 is an engineered retrovirus developed in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, Italy by Dr. ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦. It infects and mutates developing mammalian embryos, including humans, causing abnormal fetal development. Infected individuals grow to term as physically healthy fetuses lacking any anatomical features above the brain stem (see epidemiology report).",,,,,,,,
731,Euclid,2," SCP-731-1 is a steel disk 63 cm in diameter, approximately 3 cm thick, weighing 55 kg. On its upper side it resembles an ordinary manhole cover with two apertures for the insertion of lifting picks and a traction pattern embossed in its surface that resembles a maze. A logo in the center consists of two short bars with arcs extending from their midsections. The appearance of the cover does not correspond to any known utility system or manufacturer, though the logo could potentially represent ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ or ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦. On the underside of the disk is an intricate geometric pattern of etched curves whose purpose or meaning is unclear.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-731/SCP-731-2.jpg,,,,,,,

735,Euclid,2," SCP-735 was discovered in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ among the personal possessions of ¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ after said individual's body had been found, having committed suicide. The SCP in question is, in appearance, a small box constructed of a brushed-aluminum-like alloy of unknown composition featuring a slot on one side. Sound is capable of being heard through this slot. When measurements are taken, the object is found to emit low-level magnetic pulses that intensify in the presence of humans. No external power source is required, and indeed the surface of the item contains no input points.",,,,,,,,
736,Keter,3," SCP-736 is an anomaly affecting the Saturnian moon Iapetus. For brief periods generally lasting several days, Iapetus' orbit is spontaneously altered by measures of eccentricity, orbital period, or both. The orbit of Iapetus returns to its documented state after these spontaneous changes. Models of temporary orbits almost entirely consist of Iapetus undergoing orbital decay, and in most scenarios is projected to collide with Saturn (and, depending on the projection, other Saturnian moons) at some point within the next 150-300 years. These projected orbits are all in direct violation of mathematical models and both classical and relativistic physical principles, which do not predict a decay in the orbit of Iapetus due to tidal effects or gravitational radiation.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-736/iapetus.jpg,,,,,,,
737,Safe,1," The primary aspect of SCP-737 is the front carriage of a wooden toy train approximately  three (3)  five (5) centimeters tall,  two (2)  four (4) centimeters thick and when without carriages,  four (4)  six (6) centimeters long.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-737/737-new.jpg,,,,,,,

742,Keter,3," SCP-742 is a retrovirus, approximately ¦¦ times more complex than any known naturally occurring virus. SCP-742 infects all cell types but initially only enters the lytic cycle in helper-T cells, leading to a state of immuno-compromise that allows SCP-742 to infect every one of the infected subject’s cells. Infected cells secrete hormones that increase appetite as well as a signal-compound, once full infection is achieved concentration of this signal compound reaches a target level and the infection enters stage two.",,,,,,,,
743,Keter,3," SCP-743 is a stainless-steel chocolate fountain, 112 cm (44 in) tall and 47 cm (18.5 in) wide, with a mass of 35 kg (77 lb). On the base of SCP-743 is a laser-etched logo for Sephra, a company that specializes in producing chocolate fountains. SCP-743 usually appears to be in pristine condition: immaculately clean, well-polished, and completely undamaged. SCP-743 can be disassembled into its component parts (base, auger, cylinder, tiers, and crown), but standard examination of the individual components do not reveal any unusual traits.",http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-743/choco.jpg,,,,,,,

745,Euclid,2," SCP-745 is a bipedal nocturnal predator. The head is a bloated sack of clear skin that lacks visible sensory organs or a skull. The brain of the creature can be directly observed and is wrapped in a web of bio-luminescent organs below the skin. Skin covering the rest of the body has a deep black coloration. Living specimens of SCP-745 are capable of producing a steady output of 1400 to 3200 lumens from their head. At night, this effectively obscures the rest of the body and gives the appearance of a floating point of light. When defending itself or communicating with other members of its species, this light has been observed to change color and flash in specific patterns. SCP-745's genetic structure is not carbon based.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-745/745.jpg,,,,,,,
746,Euclid,2," SCP-746 is a sapient avian humanoid, standing 1.3 meters tall and weighing 38 kilograms. The entity's face appears aged, and is a deep red with a 28 centimeters long beak-like nose. Most of its body is covered in rough black feathers, the longest being on the forearms, shoulders, neck, and head.

Currently in containment there are seven (7) instances of SCP-747:",,,,,,,,
,,6," SCP-748 is an abandoned industrial complex capable of mass-production through anomalous technology. Located in Lowell, Massachusetts, SCP-748 was constructed beneath a non-anomalous factory. SCP-748's anomalous machines are rusted, damaged, and primarily disabled. Based on recovered documents, these machines would have required a level of power on par with a fusion reactor but their intended power source has yet to be discovered. The construction of SCP-748 appears to be incomplete. Evidence of this includes walled doorways, dead-end halls, and wires/pipes that connect to nothing. Posters throughout the complex display motivational/propagandistic slogans, including ""A HARD WORKER IS A HAPPY WORKER"" and ""ACTIVE MINDS LEAD TO IDLE HANDS"" (among others).",http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-748/interior,,,,,,,
749,Safe,1," SCP-749 is an apex predator superficially resembling members of the subphylum  Myriapoda , approximately 3 m long with two to three hundred pairs of legs. Each individual SCP-749 possesses powerful forcipules which secrete a powerful acidic compound with a measured pH of 0.3.",,,,,,,,
750,Safe,1," SCP-750 is a group of twenty-four (24) contact lenses, designed presumably to correct myopic or hypermetropic vision. When a pair of SCP-750 is applied, they attach to the cornea and become unable to be removed physically by the wearer, though others can still remove them. Users of SCP-750 report an immediate blurring of their vision after application, followed by a period of extreme dizziness. When the user recovers from this daze, they describe a change in perception; this change seems to worsen with time, and prolonged exposure to the object will cause a wearer to permanently suffer the noted effects of SCP-750 even when the item has been removed from the cornea, in addition to affecting the wearer's sense of touch, smell, hearing, and taste. The only method of treatment at this point is to sever the optic nerve of the affected eye(s).",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-750/contact-lens.jpg,,,,,,,
751,Euclid,2," SCP-751 is an amorphous parasite that feeds off of the organs of humans and other mammals. It weighs approximately two (2) kilograms before infesting a host, and can weigh as little as twenty-five percent (25%) of this after reproduction. The majority of SCP-751's mass consists of an unknown substance with a gelatin-like consistency, with red veins running through it. Analysis has revealed that the veins contain a mix of blood from its progenitor's hosts along with varying anesthetics and immunosuppressive drugs. A full list of these chemicals is available in Document 751-C.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-751/scp-751.png,,,,,,,
752,Keter,3," SCP-752 is an underground city in the northern ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ Mountains, spanning ¦¦¦ km 2 , population approximately 10,000. An array of electric lighting devices powered by a geothermal generator create day and night matching the rhythm of the outside world. A shield built of an unknown metal surrounds the entire city and blocks all known signals and radiation, including sonar. Study of this metal is restricted to on-site efforts to minimize the chances of containment breach.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-752/SCP-752.png,,,,,,,
753,Safe,1," SCP-753 is a highly advanced automaton approximately ten (10) centimeters across, six (6) centimeters wide and eight (8) centimeters tall. SCP-753 possesses two (2) pincer-like limbs protruding from its main circular body, which it uses to slowly move itself across the ground. This is likely due to SCP-753's locomotive functions having been damaged at an unknown point in its history.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-753/753-new.jpg,,,,,,,
754,"Euclid (Request for Keter classification under review, 20¦¦/¦¦/¦¦)",6," SCP-754 is superficially similar to  Convolvulus arvensis , a flowering vine commonly known as ""morning glory"" or ""field bindweed"" in North America. Its leaves and vine are red with delicate black veins. Flowers, when present, are red with black mottling. SCP-754 will propagate in a manner similar to bindweed. However, it can overgrow any object, including those typically resistant to plant growth and water too deep for root stabilization. It can attain a top growth rate of ¦ metres per hour. It is inhibited by temperatures below 250 K (-23°C), and enters a dormant state when chilled below 150 K (-123°C).",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-754/SCP_754.jpg,,,,,,,
755,"Keter, containment pending.",2," SCP-755-a (hereafter referred to as 'the vandal') is a graffiti vandal who is thought at the time of the archiving of this report to be active in San[REDACTED]ia, though the work of the artist has been sighted in eight other cities in the continental US and Europe, including Denver, CO, Newark, NJ, Muni[REDACTED] Security footage shows the vandal to be a light-skinned individual with a slim build who stands approximately two meters in height. From the basic body type shown in the footage, it is assumed though not confirmed that the vandal is male. The vandal regularly travels large cities, leaving behind instances of SCP-755-b.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-755/755.jpg,,,,,,,
756,Euclid,2," SCP-756 is a miniature solar system consisting of a single yellow sun and six orbiting planets, each with various moons and satellites. This system is restricted to the confines of a single large cell, originally intended for SCP-¦¦¦. The cell itself is now devoid of gravity and atmosphere, a state believed to be brought about by SCP-756’s “birth.”",,,,,,,,
757,Safe,1," SCP-757 is a fruit producing tree similar to  Prunus persica  (common peach tree), that is 3.63m tall. The texture and properties of its wood are identical to that of a  Malus domesticus  (apple tree); it is easily broken, damaged, or burnt. Its leaves are identical to those of ordinary  Prunus persica .",,,,,,,,
758,Safe,1," SCP-758 is a young Russian male, 1.9 meters tall, weighing roughly 110 kg. Full name Vasili ¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, found in ¦¦¦¦¦¦, Russia in 19¦¦. The subject was diagnosed as an extremely low functioning autistic at the age of four.",,,,,,,,
759,Euclid,2," SCP-759 is a 500-gram mass of sourdough starter composed primarily of wheat flour and water. The starter's active component is an ongoing culture of wild yeasts (including  Candida milleri  and  Saccharomyces exiguus ) in symbiotic balance with multiple strains of  Lactobacillus  and  Acetobacter  organisms. The original sample first came to Foundation attention after a sudden spontaneous outbreak of attempted murders motivated by apparently baseless jealousy in [REDACTED] County, Vermont. Without exception, the would-be murderers had recently participated in a pancake breakfast fundraiser at the local Methodist church. Further investigation led directly to a single batch of 'Old-Fashioned Melt-In-Your-Mouth Sourdough Flapjacks' produced by a chef with a longstanding untreated case of borderline personality disorder. The chef's starter was confiscated and replaced with a visually and olfactorily indistinguishable sample of equal mass and volume.",,,,,,,,
760,Safe,1," SCP-760 is a vaguely humanoid species of animal, only three of which have ever been obtained by the Foundation. The skeletal and muscular system of SCP-760 differ greatly in areas from those of humans, the most notable effects of these differences being legs that extrude perpendicular to the torso and an ape-like curvature of the spine that results in a preference to walk on all fours. Other notable differences include the addition of an extra joint on each finger of SCP-760, and an average of 150% of the joint degrees of freedom that are allowed for humans. This makes SCP-760 much more flexible than the average human, which aids specimens of SCP-760 during feeding.",,,,,,,,
761,Safe,1," SCP-761 is a steel trampoline frame, 2m in diameter and 3.5 meters tall. It shows no manufacturers mark, apart from a tag on the bottom of the original net which reads ""PROTO-5"".",,,,,,,,
762,Safe,1," SCP-762-1 is a torture device similar to the infamous Iron Maiden of Nuremberg. It was recovered in 19¦¦ from a box in the basement of [DATA EXPUNGED] in ¦¦¦¦¦¦, Austria. When opened, SCP-762 was found to have a male human in it, now known as SCP-762-2. When found inside SCP-762-1, SCP-762-2 had the device’s large spikes embedded in his flesh, but when removed from SCP-762-1, all of the subject’s wounds healed instantly. SCP-762-2 was found to be completely catatonic, but otherwise in decent health except for several rotten teeth and a large scar on his left arm. Given the unique properties of SCP-762-1, it may be impossible to determine how long SCP-762-2 was in the device. Dating on the device shows that it dates back to the late fifteenth century, so it is possible that SCP-762-2 has been in the device for centuries.",,,,,,,,
763,Safe,1," SCP-763 is a mass of human organic tissue occupying approximately three hundred (300) square meters of space with an estimated mass of over four thousand (4,000) kilograms. It is mostly in an irregular configuration of tissue, with the exception of SCP-763-A. Much of the mass of SCP-763 is muscular tissue with an abundance of blood vessels. This muscle tissue is highly atrophied and non-motile, though despite lack of use there is a great amount of blood flow at all times. Most of the structure is relatively thin at around ten (10) centimeters thick, allowing the blood flow to diffuse the high heat generated by the central mass, which is a large lump approximately two (2) meters high. This blood flow is provided by a large, central collection of hearts and a number of other hearts arrayed throughout SCP-763's structure. All the organs of the human body are present in SCP-763, located in a relatively even distribution throughout the system. The lungs are fed by a number of mouth-like round holes in SCP-763's skin. The feeding tubes pass directly into SCP-763 as though the flesh grew around them as its mass expanded.",,,,,,,,
764,Safe,1," SCP-764 is a pair of Punch and Judy puppets that display no exceptional characteristics upon visual inspection. When observed by individuals with no barrier between them and SCP-764-1 or SCP-764-2, a compulsion comes over a single person to 'put on a show' utilizing the puppets, even if none present have any skill, talent, or training regarding puppeteering. All others feel an overwhelming urge to watch the show, regarding all events taking place as the height of entertainment until the show is over. As the subject dons SCP-764-1 and SCP-764-2 (in no circumstances have SCP-764-1 and SCP-764-2 been seen placed on separate performers), any individuals without physical barriers between themselves and SCP-764 will find themselves compelled to sit and watch the show. The show begins as a normal Punch and Judy show, with light slapstick comedy and violence occurring between the puppets.",,,,,,,,
765,Safe,1," SCP-765 is a duck pond, discovered in the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ region of South Carolina in 197¦. SCP-765 appears to emanate an emotional effect causing what researchers have called ""serenity."" Researchers, guards, and test subjects within the field of SCP-765 report relaxed feelings, contentment with their life, and justification with their life choices. However, after seven to twelve days, the shift becomes one of lethargy, apathy, boredom, and depression. Further shifts beyond this are currently being monitored, with test subjects D-02841, D-02844, and D-02851 having been in the effect for over a ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦. Psychological reports on all these subjects are available at request with approval from Dr. G¦¦¦¦.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-765/duckpond-new.jpg,,,,,,,
766,Safe,1," SCP-766 is a human-shaped anomaly in space that matter cannot pass through, making it, in effect, an invisible ""statue"" of a person. Plaster applied to the anomaly has allowed researchers to study its shape: It is in the shape of a perfectly anatomically correct nude woman in her late 30s with features consistent with the native population of the island. It is running, mid-stride, and looking behind, up, and to the left. The right hand forms a fist with the fingers leaving a hollow, cylindrical opening, suggesting that it once held an implement of some sort. A band on the left shoulder is indented in a way that the strap of a satchel might cause. SCP-766's facial expression appears both exhausted and startled.",,,,,,,,
767,Euclid,2, SCP-767 is the designation of a series of objects which was recovered from [REDACTED] Police Department on ¦¦/¦¦/19¦¦.,,,,,,,,
768,Safe,1," SCP-768 is a Seiko-brand travel alarm clock that is physically identical to a regular unit of its model in all regards. Its anomalous property is activated when the alarm feature of the clock is set and the alarm activates: instead of emitting a beeping alarm as in normal units of its model, it instead causes all alarms and alerts within 300 m to trigger. How SCP-768 accomplishes this is currently unknown, as disassembling SCP-768 and analyzing its components has revealed no irregularities or anomalous materials.",,,,,,,,
769,Safe,1," SCP-769 is a cup ten centimeters tall and twelve centimeters across. It is made of pottery with a golden glaze. It is covered with a white residue. Several preserved parts from cephalopods and other sea creatures are stuck in the residue. A pattern is carved into its rim; however, the pattern is obscured by the residue. It has been decided not to attempt removal of this residue or the items stuck within it, as efforts to restore SCP-769 may hamper its effects even further.",,,,,,,,
770,Keter,3," SCP-770 is a strain of mould that is similar in appearance to the common  Physarum polycephalum  slime mould. It is largely colourless and translucent in appearance, and will adhere to almost any surface. What sets SCP-770 apart is that it respires without oxidisation by means of a poorly understood nuclear reaction. When present on a surface, SCP-770 will absorb any radioactive isotopes, or any isotopes larger in atomic mass than iron-56, with preference given to heavier isotopes. These isotopes will then undergo a nuclear reaction in which they are reduced to more stable isotopes, and energy is released. The decay products of this reaction (normally lighter elements such as carbon, oxygen, or nitrogen), along with the energy produced, are used by SCP-770 as a source of sustenance so it may grow and reproduce (which it does by the periodic release of airborne spores). There is a strong possibility that the elements produced by SCP-770 will also be radioactive isotopes.",,,,,,,,
771,Keter,3," SCP-771 is a form of A.I. that appears to be constructed out of both organic and mechanical components. The metal components of SCP-771 are of varied origin and composition, with several still unidentified, but many appear to be broken or damaged. Its biological components appear to be extremely decayed, appearing to suffer from some form of degenerative disease or virus, with the mechanical components acting as a form of life support. Due to this impaired state, SCP-771 cannot function properly, and can only function for short periods of time, with many errors and ""glitches"" during that time.",,,,,,,,
772,Euclid,2," SCP-772 is a wasp of unknown species, superficially resembling members of the  Megarhyssa  genus. A mature adult is typically 60 cm in length, from head to abdomen, excluding antennae and ovipositor. This barbed ovipositor, reaching a length of up to 70 cm, is used to penetrate its host and deposit anywhere from 5 to 20 eggs. Eggs are typically 6 cm long and 2.5 cm in diameter. SCP-772 is meticulous and almost surgical during oviposition: it makes an incision no longer than 3 cm, and the host is paralysed and/or comatose for several hours until the wound can heal sufficiently. Injected along with the eggs is a polydnavirus uniquely adapted to suppress the immune system of mammals, analogous to the smaller parasitoid wasps which do the same to their caterpillar hosts.",https://i.postimg.cc/WN624Jkp/SCP-772.jpg,,,,,,,
773,Safe,1," SCP-773 is a standard English style dartboard with a diameter of 451 mm. It is divided into the standard twenty segments and an inner and outer bulls eye ring, along with the standard double and triple bands. SCP-773 was acquired by Agent ¦¦¦¦¦¦ from a Mr. ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ of Gloucester, England residence, after an anomalous police report came to the attention of the Foundation. Mr. ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ was found dead in his home, with several ruptured blood vessels, and a heart attack which proved fatal. Police were unable to identify any cause of death.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-773/FivesDartboard.jpg,,,,,,,
774,Safe,1," SCP-774 is a by-product of the halogen azide [REDACTED] when [PROCESS REDACTED]. When in contact with the skin, it permeates the body's tissues and selectively attacks bone, dissolving the bone mineral and leaving only the soft collagen. This can occur in minutes or over the course of days, depending on the degree of exposure.",,,,,,,,
775,Keter,3," SCP-775 appears to be a form of arachnid of the order Ixodida, more commonly known as the tick. It is of a significantly larger size, with most un-engorged adults reaching a size comparable with a U.S. nickel. Coloration varies between black, red, yellow, grey, and various shades of each. Adults possess eight legs, while juveniles possess only six. SCP-775 is capable of making small leaps, and travels very rapidly along solid surfaces.",,,,,,,,
776,Euclid,2," SCP-776-A is the adult population of a remote town located in the far northwest corner of Russia, estimated at 6¦¦ individuals. The members of SCP-776-A have discovered a method of reversing biological aging, designated SCP-776-B. The ritual involves the sacrifice of a human being who must be younger than the performer of the ritual, with children being the preferable subjects of sacrifice. The complete instructions for enacting SCP-776-B have been recorded in Document 776-109-Alpha, a Level 776-4 restricted document. Members of SCP-776-A claim to have been using SCP-776-B since 18¦¦ to sustain eternal life and semi-eternal youth. Members of SCP-776-A refuse to divulge the origins of SCP-776-B. The average age of SCP-776-A members ranges from 23 to 51 years of age. This cycle of aging progresses as follows:",,,,,,,,
777,Euclid,2," SCP-777 is an area of land spanning five square kilometers located in the ¦¦¦¦¦¦ Desert, referred to by locals as 'The Kingdom of Sand'.

Whether ""Paradise Falls"" exists is currently unknown and perhaps unknowable.",,,,,,,,
779,Safe,1," SCP-779 is a species of insect similar in appearance to the common bee or a wasp. Specimens of SCP-779 are typically colored red and black, although variations in this have been noted among their populace. SCP-779 usually breed and live in human residences, but sightings of SCP-779 have been reported at rivers and lakes, suggesting the possible existence of a subspecies.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-779/779-new.jpg,,,,,,,
780,Safe,1," SCP-780 is a small bead, 1 cm in diameter, shaped like a rounded gem with numerous facets and a hole at its center. It appears to be made of a clear amorphous substance; studies suggest it has a structure similar to that of polyvinyl chloride, but this does not account for its reaction to plants. While SCP-780 does not melt at temperatures exceeding 3500 K, cooling it to below 24 K temporarily changes its structure into a crystalline form, allowing it to be damaged by blunt impacts.",,,,,,,,
,Euclid,2," SCP-781 appears to be a human male of Mediterranean descent, approximately [REDACTED] years old as of ¦/¦/10. However, when he was first recovered in ¦/¦/97, he appeared to be approximately [REDACTED] years old. Autopsies performed on the subject have determined SCP-781 to be physiologically identical to average humans. The reasons for any anomalies surrounding SCP-781, including decreased rate of aging, are unknown.",,,,,,,,
782,Safe,1," SCP-782 is an anonymously published self-help book entitled ""Three Easy Steps to an All-New You"". No author is listed, and its publisher, ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦, closed in 199¦. As ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ was a so-called ""vanity publisher"", none of the individuals associated with it claim to remember such a book, or indeed most of the books they published. In addition, all of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦'s records were destroyed when its CEO, ¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, burnt down the company's head office in an attempt to commit insurance fraud. Due to these factors, SCP-782's unknown origins should not be considered paranormal in nature.",,,,,,,,
783,Keter,3," SCP-783 is a hostile entity currently preying upon the residents of Temby, a rural hamlet in Oxfordshire, England. It has a period of activity lasting roughly seventy days over the fall and winter months, occurring every twelve years.

Its appearance matches a conventional kitchen funnel, and the symbols ""8 OZ."" are embossed on the outside just under the rim of the large end, but the funnel has an internal diameter of 1.14 m across its wide end and 9.50 cm across its narrow end. Its internal volume is 408.8 liters, which is approximately 1730 times larger than its professed 8 ounce capacity or a factor of 12 3 .",,,,,,,,
787,Safe,1," SCP-787 is a Boeing 747-200 airliner of unknown manufacturing date and call sign. The exterior of SCP-787 has been painted over, including all passenger windows: Paint was wet upon recovery, drying soon after. The mechanical components of SCP-787 are all undamaged and functional, and show no signs of use. Nonmechanical components of SCP-787, including carpeting, upholstery, and luggage, are in an advanced state of decay. The pilot and co-pilot’s seats have been removed, replaced with two piles of computer components arranged in the shape of chairs.",,,,,,,,
788,Euclid,2," SCP-788 is a creature resembling an African carp ( Labeo coubie ), approximately 3.2 m in length and composed entirely of ultramafic magma with a 'skin' of cracked picritic basalt. It is currently estimated to have a core temperature of approximately 1475 degrees Centigrade, though its skin temperature is typically much lower. Samples obtained from SCP-788 have shown no differentiation or internal structure.",,,,,,,,
789,Euclid,2," SCP-789 is an entity which resides within a well-kept, if apparently abandoned three-bedroom two-story house located in the outskirts of [REDACTED], North Dakota. Foundation databases contain no records of unrelated abnormal events in the area's history. No anomalous materials have been located in the house’s construction.",,,,,,,,
790,Euclid,2," SCP-790 is the animated blood of a human identified as Mr ¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦- hereafter known as SCP-790-01; at present, it emanates almost constantly from SCP-790-01’s pores, tear ducts, salivary glands, and several deep wounds and scars that cover at least 70% of his body. These wounds are believed to be produced by SCP-790 itself over the course of several months.",,,,,,,,
791,Safe,1," SCP-791 appears to be a mass of liquid water held in a spherical shape by an unknown and undetectable force. Biological tissues can pass through SCP-791 as they would through normal water, and reports indicate the water to be similar to normal sea water, but with a lower salt content. It is impossible to “splash” SCP-791, however, water may be drawn out via the hands or mouth.",,,,,,,,
792,Euclid,2," SCP-792 is a wooded area measuring 4 square kilometers near the town of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦. SCP-792 contains, at any given time, between 37 and 4,500 human corpses, hereby designated SCP-792-1. Instances of SCP-792-1 vary greatly in race, age, etc., with slight trends existing towards Caucasian and Hispanic descent and heightened age. All specimens are nude.",,,,,,,,
793,Euclid,2," SCP-793 is described as a hyper-reproductive paranormal variation of Human Congo trypanosomiasis (a parasitic protozoa also known as the ""African Sleeping Sickness"") inhabiting the abandoned ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦ Medicinal Center located in [DATA EXPUNGED], built by ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ missionaries in 18¦¦. SCP-793's first known appearance was documented in 19¦¦. The hospital was subsequently relinquished from use ¦ years after due to exponential growth of SCP-793, but it was never demolished due to superstitions the populous and prominent ¦¦¦¦¦ and ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ tribes held. In 19¦¦, the hospital was secured by the Foundation. SCP-793, in its passive form, does not appear to exist unless a suitable human host enters the Zone of Denial (ZoD), which is currently estimated to be 13.4 meters from any point around the hospital.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-793/793-1.jpg,,,,,,,

According to markings in Cyrillic, the vessel is the [REDACTED], built in ¦¦¦¦ in the city of [REDACTED] in 19¦¦. This is inconsistent with available records, as no vessel by this name was ever constructed. The vessel is in an advanced state of disrepair consistent to exposure to the elements for a period of at least ¦¦ years, and to date it is not known how SCP-794-01 came to rest in its current location, nearly ¦¦¦ km from any body of water.",,,,,,,,
795,Euclid,2," SCP-795 is a large (8.2 kg) black long-haired domestic cat ( Felis catus ) of indeterminate breed, exhibiting two major anomalous abilities:",,,,,,,,
796,Euclid,2," SCP-796 is a condition whereby an affected individual begins to perceive a large feline entity in their peripheral vision. The exact appearance of said entity has so far not been ascertained; while the majority of subjects have described it as unusually large and dark-coloured, separate accounts of its shape, exact size, and overall body structure have been inconsistent. Affected subjects will often experience a strong sense of paranoia and dread, largely assumed to be a result of the entity's constant presence. However, no hostility has ever been reported on the part of the entity. Instead, SCP-796 will result in the manifestation of the following minor and largely harmless physical phenomena:",,,,,,,,
797,Euclid,2," SCP-797 is an oval-shaped object attracted to either dying or freshly deceased humans. SCP-797 is almost always seen with SCP-797-01, a collection of human flesh from various cadavers. When accompanied by SCP-797-01, subject will attempt to interact with any living human entering its containment.",,,,,,,,
798,Safe,1," SCP-798 resembles a healthy adult grey/beige rat. However, it has been seen to engage in behaviours usually associated with corvids or higher mammals, such as self-awareness, problem solving, and the limited use of tools, suggesting heightened intelligence. SCP-798’s dietary requirements, sleep patterns, and metabolism are normal for  Rattus norvegicus , and blood tests confirm that it belongs to this species.",,,,,,,,
,,6," Members of SCP-799 vary in size, shape, and superficial appearance, but always retain the appearance of a knit or woven item of bedding made from an unfamiliar but very soft natural fiber (resembling high-quality merino wool blend but identified as [DATA EXPUNGED]). An individual's mass ranges from approximately 0.5 to 6 kg and does not change except through ingestion and excretion, so any immediate increase in area comes at the expense of thickness and fabric ""weight"". The blanket retains heat unusually well. Its coloration and markings are highly variable; it tends strongly towards pastel hues and patterns resembling stylized neotenous animals, particularly when its mass is less than about 2 kg.",,,,,,,,
800,Euclid,2," SCP-800 is a 42 cm x 166 cm East Asian paper scroll painting of variable style and subject. Radioisotopic dating has determined that it dates from the mid-19th century. SCP-800 currently displays as an ink painting of two Korean warriors placed above one another, the upper armed with a bow and the lower armed with a  saingeom -style sword. The painting style resembles 17th century Joseon dynasty art, despite SCP-800's paper scroll being more common in Japanese or Chinese painting.",http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-800/eagle%20painting.jpg,,,,,,,
801,Euclid,2," SCP-801 is a collection of seven articles of fur clothing, found inside a hunting lodge in the Adirondack mountains. Attempts to trace the owner of the lodge were unsuccessful; though locals insisted that they had seen lights and heard gunshots in the area until recently, Foundation personnel discovered no further evidence of recent occupation.",,,,,,,,
802,Euclid,2," SCP-802 appears to be a World War II era Renault Char B1 medium battle tank. However, unlike regular tanks, SCP-802 is able to operate on its own. It is unknown whether SCP-802 is sapient, or possesses any sort of intelligence at all, but it is clear through long-range infrared scans and constant surveillance that SCP-802 has no physical crew manning it. The tank itself, while operational, is in incredibly poor condition. While personnel have been unable to get close enough to properly examine it, it is clear that it is heavily damaged. The top turret is completely missing, its hull weapon is non-operational, the treads are nearly falling off, and the hull is pitted and worn with age and battle damage. However, it is still capable of operating beyond its projected performance specifications and is able to achieve speeds of up to 40 kilometers per hour as opposed to the documented 28 kilometers per hour. Infrared scans have also shown signs of trace heat around where the engines should be located, which are inconsistent with the heat signatures of a conventional engine, making SCP-802's primary method of propulsion unknown. SCP-802 is also highly resistant to damage. Attempts to destroy it have been met with failure, as SCP-802 can take repeated hits from anti-tank weapons and remain operational. While the damage caused only seems to be cosmetic at best, it can successfully drive SCP-802 away temporarily.",,,,,,,,
803,Euclid,2," SCP-803-1 is a currently undetermined number of autonomous machines, resembling small umbrellas, averaging 170 centimetres in width and 150 centimetres in height. An average specimen is almost indistinguishable from a normal umbrella. There are no identifying marks or labels on instances of SCP-803-1. When unfolded, a large amount of medical equipment is visible on the underside of SCP-803-1's canopy. These include vials of varying liquids and gases, plastic tubing, syringes, scalpels, various motors and joints, [DATA EXPUNGED]. All specimens possess the ability to retract, disguise or otherwise hide this equipment, making identification of SCP-803-1 in the field difficult. All attempts to disassemble or deactivate instances of SCP-803 are forbidden by order of Dr. ¦¦¦¦¦¦ (see addendum 803-01).",,,,,,,,
804,Keter,3," SCP-804 is the remains of an art installation titled ""World Without Man,"" revealed on ¦¦/¦¦/20¦¦, by the defunct artists' group  Unelmat Paremmasta Maailmasta . According to documentation retrieved and deleted from the artists' website during clean-up procedure, SCP-804 was originally a large, clear globe of the Earth, with several smaller globes and video equipment within. Promotional material on the website implied that the globe was to display images of pastoral wilderness untouched by mankind contrasted with visuals of abandoned human industry and decaying landmarks.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-804/ice-ball-new.JPG,,,,,,,
805,Euclid,2," SCP-805 is an assortment of branches and roots twisted into the shape of a young horse, 101.6 cm high. Its interior is completely hollow of any organs; however, the object is mobile, mimicking the movements and instincts of a typical young foal. It is drawn toward human presences, actively seeking contact with skin, and has been reported as being 'very friendly' when approached. It does not require food or water and there has been no growth recorded since containment in 20¦¦. Scrapings of wood from its frame have revealed it to be of an unknown species related to the 'poison-oak' plant,  Toxicodendron diversilobum .",,,,,,,,
806,Safe,1," SCP-806 is a large, modified film projector, originally built circa 1900. The item’s lens has been replaced with one constructed of several dozen thin layers of shaved precious stones and as of yet unidentified materials. The original projection bulb has been replaced by an LED array. Originally built for 35mm film, most inner mechanisms have been retrofitted with similar components of various complex alloys. These modifications also allow for most film sizes to be played. Additional mechanisms have been installed, allowing for multiple spools of film to be played through the item without interruption.",http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-806/806%20projector,,,,,,,
807,Euclid,2," SCP-807 is a salmon-colored ceramic dinner plate 20 cm in diameter with the words ""Last Chance Diner"" printed on the edges in white. A small piece has been chipped out of one edge of the plate, just above the letter D. There are no manufacturer's marks, and to date, all efforts to find the restaurant in question have failed.",,,,,,,,
808,Euclid,2," SCP-808 is a mechanical construct standing approximately sixteen (16) meters tall, with a base approximately five by six meters (30 m 2 ) in area. The object is roughly cylindrical in shape, the upper three meters tapering to a point.",http://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-808/808%20innards%20added,,,,,,,
809,Safe,1," SCP-809 is a heavily stained and worn pair of leather boots, designated SCP-809-1 and SCP-809-2 for the left and right boot respectively. Forensic analysis of the boots confirms that the stains are composed of clay-rich soil and human blood. The design of SCP-809 is consistent with those of the boots worn by French infantry in the last years of World War One.",,,,,,,,
810,Euclid,2," Object appears to be a standard oil lamp dating back some 1-2 thousand years. No biological material has been observed on the SCP, and the circumstances of its recovery make exact dating impractical. When touched by a human, an inscription appears in Aramaic. It reads, roughly 'Ask what you will, and you shall never want for it.' If the SCP is firmly grasped by a human for at least thirty seconds, the inscription will change to the holder's native language. This change is physical, and has been recorded.",,,,,,,,
811,Euclid,2," SCP-811 is shaped similarly to a human female with disproportionally long and thin limbs and a slightly-bloated abdominal region. It is 171 cm tall, and weighs just under 47 kg due to its strange physiology (see Addendum 811-2 for details). Its skin has slight abrasive properties, and is a mottled green color that serves to camouflage it among the reeds in its natural habitat. Its sweat has been observed to act as a mild skin irritant. It has extremely oily black hair that has proven to be resistant to cleaning with conventional shampoos (See Addendum 811-1). It shows partial comprehension of human language, consistent with case studies of ""feral children"" that had been abandoned at a few years old, instead of as infants.",,,,,,,,
812,Euclid,2," SCP-812 is a nondescript cargo container of corrugated steel measuring 12m x 2.5m x 2.5m. There is a sliding door measuring 2m x 2m set in one of the long sides, and a set of double doors is built into one of the square ends. The object is painted dull red and partially covered with spray-paint graffiti. Official markings include the number 247 and the word ""ANTHERCORP,"" which identifies no commercial entity. The object weighs approximately 4000 kg when empty and can hold up to 26,500 kg.",,,,,,,,
813,Keter,3," SCP-813 is a spherical glass sculpture. Evidence suggests that the sculpture was originally 45cm in diameter; however, the artifact is currently missing approximately 17% of its initial mass. Close inspection of SCP-813 has revealed a microscopic system of seemingly metallic clockwork machinery. This machinery is continuously active, though the means by which it accumulates or generates power is unclear. The properties of the artifact (see below) have prevented more extensive inspection of the machinery, and spectroscopic analysis has proven inconclusive.",,,,,,,,
814,Euclid,2," SCP-814-1 is an ornate mahogany enclosure housing an antique wax-cylinder type phonograph (c. 1900 CE) of unique design. The internal mechanism, which is completely functional, is capable of holding up to four music cylinders; notably, it is capable of the replay of multiple cylinders simultaneously. The manufacturer's mark ""SYNCOPE"" is etched on several of the phonograph's components.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-814/phonograph-new.jpg,,,,,,,
815,,NA," SCP-815 is a novelty “snake nut can,” a common prank device that consists of a small canister labeled “Salted Mixed Nuts,” while in actuality it contains four cloth-covered springs (meant to represent ""snakes"") that fly out upon opening. X-ray and multi-spectral imaging have as yet determined no measurable unusual qualities of the can or ""snakes"".",,,,,,,,
816,Euclid,2," SCP-816 is the name given to the collection of small automata residing in the basement of the house at ¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ Street, ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, Switzerland. Journals found in the basement indicate that ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, a local teacher, originally created SCP-816 in 189¦. Inspired by the works of Charles Darwin and Charles Babbage, he designed and built automata capable of reproducing and evolving. The mechanics of reproduction are facilitated by a collection of parts common to all species; however, most species modify the base parts to create specialized parts to fit their ecological niche.",,,,,,,,
817,Euclid,2," SCP-817 is a humanoid of indeterminate gender and variable physical features, although genetic testing suggests it was once ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦, a young Asian male. SCP-817 periodically undergoes radical metamorphic changes to its physiology. The delay between metamorphic events varies but is usually about two (2) to three (3) months. These shifts and the physiological abnormalities produced cause SCP-817 enormous pain, however it seems to suffer no actual damage to its body systems. Additionally, SCP-817 seems to be incapable of deliberately injuring itself.",,,,,,,,
818,Neutralized (Previously Keter),2," SCP-818 is a young male, appearing to be approximately seven to twelve years of age. Additionally, SCP-818 displays all the signs of behaviour consistent with low-functioning nonverbal autism. The examinations of on-site behaviorists and recovered medical records show that this condition has been present for SCP-818's entire life. SCP-818's physical features have a tendency to shift when active; however, during a resting state, it has been noted as having black hair and dark skin. SCP-818 cannot speak and possesses no known direct ability to communicate. SCP-818 has shown no need for nutrition or waste removal, but it has been recorded breathing and, presumably, sleeping. SCP-818 does not appear to age, and has been known to shift between heights (ranging from 1.17 to 1.84 meters) and weights (65 to 80 kilograms), making any determination impossible. This, coupled with the incomplete state of the recovered medical records, leaves much of SCP-818's history blank.",,,,,,,,
819,Safe,1," SCP-819 was discovered in a pediatric office in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, after several reports of children being rushed back with symptoms including vision loss, severe nasal pain, and idiopathic unconsciousness. Agents dispatched found that the lollipops offered to the children were causing different bodily fluids to disappear. The candy in question was confiscated, and the office staff, affected patients and their guardians were treated and administered Class-A amnestics.",,,,,,,,
820,Euclid,2," SCP-820 is a periodically manifesting swarm of locust grasshoppers that appears in certain areas of [REDACTED] and Peru colloquially known as  las langostas pintadas , or ""the painted locusts"".",,,,,,,,
821,,5," SCP-821 is a structure located within the former town of Esheville, FL. Records recovered from the local government indicate it was constructed sometime between 1955-1957. The interior is in a permanent state of degradation, with all attempts at maintenance or restoration being unsuccessful.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-821/821-new.jpg,,,,,,,
822,Euclid,2," SCP-822 is a species of cactus similar in appearance to  Lophophora williamsii  (Peyote) but with significant differences as the plant reaches maturity within a period of approximately thirty (30) days. As SCP-822 nears maturity, a large gas sac forms within the center of the plant as it reaches its typical maximum dimensions of approximately 10cm in height and 25cm in diameter. This sac is filled with volatile gasses including ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦¦¦, and several substances unique to SCP-822. At the same time, the skin of SCP-822 hardens until it reaches a point not unlike sheet metal and seeds begin to form just under the skin. Once the plant is fully mature, it flowers and begins extruding a pheromone that serves to attract mammals of sufficient mass to trigger its anomalous property.",,,,,,,,
823,Euclid,2," SCP-823 is an abandoned theme (amusement) park located in ¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦¦¦¦. Site was abandoned in ¦¦¦¦ after several violent events resulting in the deaths of park attendees. A complete list of said events is included in Supplement 823-01-13, ""Civilian Deaths Attributed to SCP-823.""",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-823/823-005.jpg,,,,,,,
824,Euclid-alterier,5," SCP-824 is a species of tree that is characterized by significant mobility and herbivory. While SCP-824 specimens superficially resemble members of the Ginkgoaceae family, SCP-824 is radically different from any known species of plant.",,,,,,,,
825,Safe,1," SCP-825 is a standard-sized helmet of medieval design. The degree of wear is consistent with this dating, provided SCP-825 has been well cared for. This is entirely probable, as it was liberated from [DATA EXPUNGED] despite frequent use [DATA EXPUNGED] how long the group had been in possession of SCP-825, as the only surviving members were not present when [DATA EXPUNGED] and has itself been designated SCP-¦¦¦. Efforts are still in place to track down anyone else involved in the incident.",,,,,,,,
826,Safe,1," SCP-826 is a 20 cm x 15 cm pair of bookends, molded in the shape of two outward-facing dragon heads. Scrapings from the surface of SCP-826 revealed a composition of 99% Sn, 0.5% Cu, 0.3% Sb, and 0.2% Pb, consistent with high-grade pewter. However, it is unclear whether SCP-826 is solid pewter or whether the pewter is merely a plating for some unknown element which gives the SCP its properties.",,,,,,,,
827,Safe,1," SCP-827 is a semi-solid mass of biologically active human stem cells. SCP-827 is capable of self-renewal and is totipotent, with cells replacing themselves at a rate of approximately 200,000 cycles of mitosis per day, with roughly the same amount dying off per day; at time of writing, SCP-827's mass is currently 353kg, and remains stable.",,,,,,,,
828,Euclid,2," SCP-828-1 is a humanoid organism that stands 1.4 meters tall with white, pupilless eyes and long ""hair"" composed of kelp-like unbranched stipes of  Alaria esculenta 3 . The subject's skin resembles that of fish of the  Myoxophalus 4  genus. SCP-828-1 is amphibious but cannot remain out of water for more than 10 minutes without suffering from dehydration. The subject's hands and feet are webbed to facilitate swimming. Medical examination of the ""hair"" has revealed that it is permeated by extensive vasculature indicating that the organ is used for gas exchange. The subject's body appears emaciated, but the subject has yet to request food. If offered food SCP-828-1 will consume it ""to be polite"", but it is unclear if the subject requires regular feeding. The subject was found with severe tooth decay, and has been provided with dentures and dental care after containment. When out of water, the subject's skin emits an odor that has been unanimously described as pleasant by all prepubescent human subjects. Importantly, children have described the scent as comforting and ""maternal"" during interviews. Analysis of the subject's skin secretions has revealed the presence of a volatile organic substance which may act as a pheromone. It is hypothesized that this compound may aid the subject in its efforts to befriend children. Research into the mechanism of action is ongoing.",,,,,,,,
829,Safe-Kerveni,4,Description:,https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-829/concorde_sm.png,,,,,,,
830,Safe,1, SCP-830 is a shifting pool that initially appears to be composed of oil and sand. Attempts to recover samples from the pool have revealed only inert samples standard to the earth in that area. Researchers hypothesize that an item at the bottom of this pool may be responsible for this and the other effects of SCP-830.,,,,,,,,
831,Euclid,2," SCP-831 is a species of tool-using insect-like organisms superficially resembling wingless worker-caste  Reticulitermes flavipes . Colonies of SCP-831 have been collected or eradicated in eleven locations in eastern and central North America to date, in locations ranging from Texas to Ontario. The organisms appear to be capable of feeding on most organic material, with a preference for cellulose and sugars. Mature specimens range from 7 mm to 1.2 cm in length. Individual specimens appear to have a lifespan of 25 to 40 days. Unlike true termites, SCP-831 does not appear to be divided into castes with distinct morphology; all specimens are essentially “workers” and all females are capable of breeding with an extremely short gestation period.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-831/termite-new.jpg,,,,,,,
832,Safe,1," SCP-832 appears to be a US half dollar minted in 1966. Closer analysis has revealed that it is composed of an alloy consistent with half dollars minted at the time. When a subject comes into direct physical contact with SCP-832, the subject gains the ability to recite exactly how much money they have at any given time, even if asked for the amount in a form that they are not storing it in. Subjects so far have demonstrated the ability to calculate their wealth in:",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-832/1966-kennedy-half-dollar.png,,,,,,,
833,Euclid,2," SCP-833 is a parasitic nematode of the genus  Trichinella  only capable of infesting humans. Infestation by SCP-833 has symptoms similar to a mild case of trichinosis, often including initial intestinal distress followed by muscle pain and fever about a week after infection. Symptoms fade after about three weeks. In many cases, infestation is asymptomatic. As with all varieties of trichinosis, the disease is spread by the consumption of tainted meat. SCP-833 is highly heat resistant, but responds favorably to standard vermicides, especially albendazole.",,,,,,,,
834,,5," SCP-834 is a set of four markers (black, red, yellow and blue.) Each marker bears only a ' The Factory ' logo, and no other distinguishing characteristics.  The only effect of these markers is that they write permanently on human skin, resulting in tattoo-like markings. Testing has proven the ink sinks below the surface of the skin, and is only removable via laser dermabrasion, or similar tattoo removal procedures.  See Addendum.",,,,,,,,
835,Keter,3," SCP-835 appears to be a large mass of coral-like polyps weighing ¦¦¦¦ tons. The individual polyps are larger than any known coral species, growing to more than one meter in diameter in some cases. The central mass is roughly oval shaped, with a very large (3 meter diameter) polyp at each “end”. SCP-835 is incapable of locomotion, and appears to anchor itself with the large tentacles projected from the SCP-835 polyps. These are also used in feeding, and are coated with a sticky adhesive substance. The tentacles are also quite strong, and have been shown to be capable of damaging plate steel.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-835/flbalanus-new.jpg,,,,,,,
836,Keter,3," SCP-836 is the designation given to a condition occurring within clay, bricks or concrete, though secondary propagation can affect most known structural materials. The initiating factors are currently subject to research, though the likelihood of SCP-836 appearance increases rapidly for structures over ¦¦¦ years old.",,,,,,,,
837,Safe,1, SCP-837 is a quantity of brown clay with two anomalous properties.,,,,,,,,
838,Safe,1," SCP-838 is the collective term for a series of job ads appearing in newspapers that print in the vicinity of Chicago, and whatever agency is behind them. The job offered varies between instances, and has included positions in accounting, management, and janitorial work, among others. These ads are entirely mundane unless responded to. Attempts to trace these classifieds have proven unsuccessful.",,,,,,,,
839,Safe,1," SCP-839 appears to be a species of annelid composed of sugar, flavouring and colouring. A microscopic label stating ""CANDIED WORM"" is found near each instance's posterior, followed by a smaller label stating the instance's ""flavour"". Each ""flavour"" is currently designated as SCP-839-x.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-839/scp839.png,,,,,,,
840,Euclid,2," SCP-840 is a type of amoeba that thrives in dark, damp environments, which given the correct circumstances will form a unique symbiotic relationship, ‘fusing’ together by secreting an extremely viscous mucus. These fused colonies are capable of replicating many of the functions of animal tissues, particularly that of vital organs. Although SCP-840 has a prolific growth and reproduction rate, colonies are capable of existing unnoticed for years.",,,,,,,,
841,Safe,1," SCP-841 is a wooden puppet crudely approximating a human being: 14 (fourteen) pieces of peeled and unworked wood from the mountain white birch ( Betula cordifolia ), held together with twine at the major joints (head, torso, upper arms, lower arms, hands, thighs, lower legs, and feet). SCP-841's anomalous properties activate when it is fully assembled and comes in contact with the skin of a living human being.",,,,,,,,
842,Safe,1," SCP-842 is a 2 m x 0.8 m dilapidated antique operating table capable of remote viewing and surveillance. SCP-842 will use SCP-842-1 to display terrain, buildings, objects, and entities within the chosen viewing area. SCP-842-1 will be altered to mimic the chosen viewing area in real time, and any alterations of the viewing area or updated information will be displayed immediately on SCP-842-1.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-842/scp-842.png,,,,,,,
843,Euclid,2," SCP-843-1 appears to be a seed of  Phaseolus lunatus  (lima bean), painted white with black spots to resemble a typical Holstein cattle's coat. The original packaging for SCP-843-1 contained 5 of these seeds, as well as a piece of paper proclaiming the items within to be 'Cow Seeds'. SCP-843-1 is itself harmless, though when planted within 5 days SCP-843-2 will manifest.",,,,,,,,
844,Euclid,2," SCP-844 is an amorphic mass composed primarily of human bones, large amounts of dust and a form of luminescent fungus which is red in color. SCP-844 appears to prefer to dwell in dark, warm areas with minimal human presence when it is not hunting or feeding.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-844/closetscp(1)-new.jpg,,,,,,,
845,Euclid,2," SCP-845 is a species closely related to both the European polecat ( Mustela putorius ) and domesticated ferret ( Mustela putorius furo ). Specimens of SCP-845 appear similar to a common hybrid between these sub-species, with dark fur, a pointed muzzle, and an elongated body. SCP-845 demonstrates greater prevalence of social behavior and diminished territorial instinct compared to European polecats.",,,,,,,,
846,Safe,1," SCP-846 is a plastic toy robot measuring twenty (20) centimeters in height and five (5) centimeters in width. The bottom of SCP-846's right foot bears the text 'Robo-Dude® (Now with Voice Command Action), by Dr. Wondertainment!'

847,Euclid,2," SCP-847 is a human female mannequin, 156 cm tall and 27 kg in mass, constructed of human hair and an unknown composite fibrous polymer that abrades and shatters similarly to porcelain. Exploratory laparoscopy of SCP-847 shows the presence of internal structures resembling an incomplete set of bones, organs, and major blood vessels, composed of the same polymer. Small amounts of a black, volatile resin similar to plastination compounds leak from the eyes and damaged regions of the mannequin. SCP-847  has always been  is normally at some level of disrepair, with shattered areas on the torso, head, and limbs (see Addendum 847-B for details).",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-847/basement.jpg,,,,,,,
848,Euclid,2," SCP-848-1 is a colony of  Nephila clavipes  (golden silk orb-weavers, a.k.a. banana spiders). Specimens of SCP-848-1 are approximately 15% larger and significantly stronger and faster than normal specimens of  Nephila , but generally no more dangerous than a typical spider of the genus to humans and do not exhibit any particular hostility to humans in their containment.",,,,,,,,
849,Safe,1," SCP-849 is a sensory deprivation chamber first recovered by the Foundation from a health spa in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦. SCP-849 measures 3m x 4m, is white in color and is filled with an opaque, grey liquid.

851,Euclid,2," SCP-851 is a large colony of insects similar in appearance to  Eciton burchellii . This colony numbers between ¦¦¦ and ¦¦¦¦ at any given time. SCP-851 lacks a queen, and reproduces asexually.",,,,,,,,
852,Safe,1," SCP-852 is a steel and brass vehicle, strongly reminiscent of a bathyscaphe, with the name  Wings of Daedalus  in gold-plated brass affixed to the lower hull. The vehicle has a length of 21.3 meters, a beam of 4.1 meters, and a draft of 7.3 meters in total. The upper hull of the artifact has twelve 'masts' affixed to it with a length of 9.6 meters, set in two regular hexagonal patterns on the top and bottom of the upper hull, respectively. Each mast has a device on the end that projects a ""bubble"" which warps space around it in a way that does not match current spacetime theories. Presently, the devices are vacuum welded to the masts, making them difficult to remove for study.",,,,,,,,
853,Safe,1," SCP-853 consists of ¦¦¦¦ sealed canning jars of various sizes and makes. Each instance contains a differently colored substance with a visually-determined viscosity similar to that of firm gelatin.

858,Keter,3," SCP-858 is a migrating noctilucent cloud which affects cirrus cloud formations beneath it. Presence of SCP-858 can be easily identified by the iridescent refraction within the cirrus formations, which, once affected, descend until precipitation ensues. Contact with precipitation from affected clouds immediately and permanently alters solid matter on contact. While apparently nonreactive with gasses and liquids, solid state reactions cause the molecular bonds of affected items to act as a vector, conducting the effect until the entirety of affected objects or organisms is repelled by, rather than attracted by, gravitational force. Porous materials act as a secondary vector, as affected water trapped in the substance in no way loses its effectiveness 1 . Barring sufficiently sturdy objects secured to sufficiently massive objects embedded or otherwise secured to Earth's surface, this results in the affected object accelerating away from the Earth's surface at 9.8m/s 2 . Upon contact with SCP-858 itself at roughly 80km above sea level, affected objects vanish.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-858/Irid_clouds1.jpg,,,,,,,
859,Euclid,2," SCP-859 is a spherical mass of dark, unidentified material approximately 11cm in diameter that appears to be covered in multiple layers of spider webbing.

861,Keter,3," SCP-861 is a 1170L mass of liquid superficially resembling water with a fixed temperature of 27 degrees Centigrade. Any amount of the material that is forcibly displaced from the central mass will dissipate, and SCP-861 will generate an equal amount of new material to replace this loss. SCP-861 continuously emits a flame of variable color, generally violet or indigo; this flame generates no identified heat, and is non-hazardous to contact. The mass is capable of locomotion through an unidentified process, and is capable of scaling any surface at an observed maximum speed of 47km per hour. SCP-861 gravitates toward the presence of human beings, a distance of approximately 50m or closer being sufficient to determine ""presence."" If while traveling SCP-861 is obstructed, it will increase in mass until said obstruction is destroyed by the exerted pressure (SCP-861 will return to its normal size shortly thereafter).",,,,,,,,

865,Safe,1," SCP-865 is a handgun of unknown make, superficially similar to a SIG Sauer P226 of the type manufactured after 1996, and bearing no identifying marks. SCP-865 can be disassembled, cleaned, and reassembled in the same manner as a normal pistol of its type. Several circuit boards and microprocessors have been incorporated into SCP-865's grip. The purpose of these devices is not fully understood at this time.",,,,,,,,
866,Euclid,2," SCP-866 is a ¦¦¦¦ Series Supercomputer constructed in 20¦¦. Its anomalous properties were discovered when the system proved capable of running computation jobs with more processors than physically available. Subsequent attempts to determine the reason for this behavior have failed, but have caused ¦ university employees to disappear. See Addendum 1.1a for details. Foundation operatives determined the system has non-euclidian geometry in the computation node rack topology, possibly a polydimensional n-hypercube structure. This however does not account for the reason for the anomalous computations, only for their speed. An attempt to remove SCP-866 from the power supply has resulted in immediate [DATA EXPUNGED] resulting in ¦¦ displacements and disappearances, including the entire recovery team. See [REDACTED] for additional information. In situ containment measures have been devised.",,,,,,,,

873,,6," SCP-873 is a spherical object 138mm across with a detectable mass of 5.3kg. It gives the appearance of being made of flawless glass or crystal, but all attempts to determine the material of its construction have been inconclusive. No attempt to remove a sample has been successful, and spectroscopic analysis has shown no absorption spectra that can be attributed to the object. Because of its anomalous properties, its refractive index can only be estimated.",,,,,,,,
874,Euclid,2," SCP-874 is a black, largely unreflective fluid with 30.87 cP viscosity and reflectivity less than a tenth of that of water. When it approaches a static depth of 2 cm, the fluid functions as a portal to a seemingly infinite space. Telemetry into the abyss has led to no conclusive results as to its dimensions. Audio readings and personnel report the sound of distant grinding of metal and stone from this portal. Occasionally, viewers and visual recording equipment can glimpse what appears to be immense rotating ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ drifting aimlessly in the otherwise featureless blackness.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-874/874.jpg,,,,,,,
875,Safe,1," SCP-875 is an underground pyramid estimated to be ¦¦¦¦ years old and located in the ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ Desert. No evidence of SCP-875's construction exists in records from the period, although evidence suggests that SCP-875 was man-made.

883,Euclid,2," SCP-883 is a large fixed frame beehive contained in a wooden shed approximately three meters tall, one meter wide, and two meters deep on the outside. The inside of SCP-883 appears to be much larger than the shed's outer dimensions, with layers of honeycomb on the walls of the hive surrounding passages that extend for at least eight kilometers from the entrance. The interior of the hive is arranged in a maze-like fashion, although no dead ends have yet been encountered. The bees inside SCP-883 do not match any known species of genus  Apis . Most disturbingly, bees found further into SCP-883 appear to be very different from normal honeybees. Bees found more than one and a half kilometers into SCP-883 possess one pair of wings more than normal honeybees. Bees found more than two kilometers in are highly aggressive and possess a toxic sting that has failed to respond to any treatment administered so far. Several specimens recovered from more than seven kilometers into SCP-883 do not appear to be insects at all, possessing [DATA EXPUNGED].",,,,,,,,
884,,6,,,,,,,,,
885,Euclid,2," SCP-885 is a living creature of unknown composition that displaces all fluids (liquids and gases) within its perimeter. Analysis of the interior of the creature has shown no phenomena consistent with known matter: it is, for all intents and purposes, a complete vacuum.",,,,,,,,

887,Safe,1," SCP-887 is a man in his late forties, born in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, Russia. His left arm and left side of his face are partially paralyzed, resulting in slurred speech. SCP-887 recently emerged from a 17-year coma in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ Hospital, St. Petersburg, displaying nearly-complete mental recuperation aside from extreme hypergraphia. Subject claims he was conscious during the entire length of his coma, receiving communications from an unknown source; his hypergraphia is attributed to him writing down all that was told to him during this period.",,,,,,,,
888,Safe,1," SCP-888 is a mineral composite similar to a rare red quartzite found only in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, Russia; however SCP-888 also contains trace amounts of an unidentified organic compound. This stone exhibits the capacity for large-scale data storage within its molecular lattices. SCP-888 exists in two distinct states, hereafter referred to as 'empty' and 'full'. In its 'empty' state, SCP-888 is colored a pale pink, and is slightly translucent. In the 'full' state, the color deepens to a darker red, and the stone becomes completely opaque — see the attached image. It is theorized that these changes result from the realignment of the molecular lattices to contain the stored data. At this time, the source of this stone is undetermined.",,,,,,,,
889,Euclid,2," SCP-889 is an abandoned cattle barn located several miles north of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, Montana, USA. A series of farming buildings in various states of disrepair surround SCP-889. No signs of human habitation are nearby, and no information is available concerning current or previous owners.",,,,,,,,
890,Euclid,2," SCP-890 appears to be a male Caucasian between 35 and 45 years of age and approximately 1.75 meters tall. Subject is generally unremarkable, showing typical signs of aging, except for its eyes, which are achromatic, appearing gray. Personnel should avoid mentioning this, as it seems to cause subject some distress. Subject is typically dressed in surgical scrubs, green in color, and is often seen still wearing a surgical cap and mask.",,,,,,,,
891,Safe,1," SCP-891 is a field located in ¦¦¦¦¦, California. The dimensions of SCP-891 are one and a half by one kilometers. Any plant that bears edible fruit is able to grow in SCP-891, regardless of previous soil or climate needs. Plants planted in SCP-891 experience moderately accelerated growth and seem to require abnormally small amounts of water and sunlight to grow. Fruits produced by plants inside SCP-891 are larger than average and have been said to “look delicious.” Chemical analysis has revealed that compounds responsible for producing appealing texture, flavor, and aroma are abnormally high in SCP-891's fruit. Attempts by Foundation staff to render the soil of SCP-891 incapable of supporting vegetation have been unsuccessful; salting SCP-891 had no effect. However, once salted soil was removed from the grounds of SCP-891, it behaved as expected and did not support vegetation.",,,,,,,,
892,Euclid,2," SCP-892 is an Amstrad 286 Personal Computer with accompanying mouse and keyboard, running a version of Microsoft Excel 92. Attempts to export and import save files result in corruption of said files. Attempts to install and uninstall software are likewise met with failure.",,,,,,,,

On the bottom of each copy is stamped 'The Factory.' Copies of SCP-894 are easily destroyed, whether through brute strength or applied heat.",,,,,,,,
895,Euclid,2," SCP-895 is an ornate oak coffin recovered from the ¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ Mortuary by SCP personnel on ¦¦/¦/¦¦, following reports of unusual footage captured by surveillance equipment installed at that location. When questioned, mortuary staff were unable to determine the source of SCP-895 and how it was transported to the location. Upon attempting to open SCP-895, agents on location found the object empty; however, observers viewing the live camera feed were [DATA EXPUNGED]. Until further notice, SCP-895 must remain closed at all times.",,,,,,,,
896,Safe,1," SCP-896 is known to the public as ¦¦¦¦ ¦ ¦¦¦¦, a popular online role playing game. The version of SCP-896 that the public uses has no anomalous effects. However, the original code developed by ¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦ exhibits effects that warrant ¦¦¦¦ ¦ ¦¦¦¦’s classification as an SCP.",,,,,,,,
897,Safe (formerly Euclid),0," SCP-897 is an effectively immortal person of variable height, weight, and build, and indeterminate age, race, and gender. It claims to be ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, an Estonian man on record as having died in a house fire in Reval (now Tallinn) in 19¦¦, aged 70. If this were true, it would make SCP-897 ¦¦¦ years old.",,,,,,,,
898,Safe,1," SCP-898 is a memetic disorder specifically created by Foundation researchers for the purpose of serving as a defense mechanism against other memetic or mind-affecting attacks. Its development was undertaken as part of Operation Azure Skies in 1992. The objective of Azure Skies was to design and employ a variety of devices to protect Foundation personnel in the field from supernatural threats that conventional technologies were not sufficient to guard against. SCP-898 specifically was created over the course of three (3) years of study and experimentation, taking information from analyses of already known memetic SCPs to drive a gestalt Research and Development program. The SCP-898 project was overseen by Dr. Grienko during its run, until its official cancellation on December 22nd, 1995.",,,,,,,,
899,"Euclid (formerly Safe, see Incident Reports)",5," SCP-899 is a psychic and telekinetic phenomenon that most commonly manifests as groups of hostile phantom children. Travelers in the area have reported being pursued and harassed by small shadowy figures that curse and throw rocks in an attempt to drive them out of the immediate area. The figures tend to be featureless and it is usually difficult to determine if they possess any gender or even individual voices and behaviors. Failure to leave the area will result in an increase of aggressive behavior culminating in a direct physical attack by the entities. An adult who comes into physical contact with one of the entities will suffer the loss of all detailed memories prior to the onset of puberty. General knowledge of family members and living conditions will remain, but persons who have been affected by this memory loss often display a significant change in personality. The most common symptoms are a loss of impulsiveness and curiosity, and negative responses to attempts at humor. Affected persons also tend to become highly impatient with children regardless of their prior behavior.",,,,,,,,
,,6," SCP-900 is a partially submerged city located within the Pacific Ocean, approximately 300 kilometers east of Helen Reef. The area of SCP-900 is estimated to be roughly 17,000 km 2 . SCP-900 is estimated to have been constructed between 1135 and 1285 BCE and destroyed between 360 and 215 BCE.

It is L-shaped and takes up a footprint of approximately 850m 2 . Information on SCP-901's history has been difficult to obtain; questioning of the local population suggests that it has existed since 1947 at the earliest, but no records of its builders or subsequent usage have been found. It is not possible to enter SCP-901 through any method other than through the main entrance, which consists of a large mahogany double door of dimensions 5.2x4.5m, from hereon designated as SCP-901-1. SCP-901-1 opens onto a large main hall which appears to be empty when viewed from the outside. The windows, although covered with a thick coating of dirt, also show all the rooms of SCP-901 are empty. However, observers have on rare occasions reported movement, 'shadowy figures' and in one case [DATA EXPUNGED] through the windows. So far, none of these phenomena have been captured by recording devices.",,,,,,,,
902,Keter,3," SCP-902 is a box roughly the size of an adult human head. It measures 30 cm x 15 cm x 19 cm. It appears to be an ammunition box of a type used roughly thirty years ago, despite this item having been in Foundation custody for roughly sixty years. SCP-902 is made of lead. The composition of the item inside SCP-902 is unknown. SCP-902 emits what has been described as a 'ticking' sound, and anyone who hears this sound becomes convinced that the item is counting down. When opened, the box appears empty. However, the ticking remains, the object continues counting down. Anyone who becomes aware of SCP-902, whether through personal interaction, or by reading this report, becomes convinced that whatever is in the box is horribly dangerous, and needs to be destroyed as soon as it finishes counting down, and not before. Staff exposed to SCP-902 will typically continue to attempt to open and then close the box, trying to find the object inside.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-902/Old_box_in_Samarkand.JPG,,,,,,,
903,Euclid,2," SCP-903 is an incomplete Site-19 utility tunnel that connects the SCP Containment Wing with the Lambda Laboratory Wing. The tunnel is three meters in diameter, fifty meters long, and buried approximately five meters underground. Because of its incomplete nature, SCP-903 is an empty concrete tunnel that contains no piping, wiring, or other utility equipment. SCP-903 also contains an old rail system that consists of a single monorail that spans the entire length of SCP-903.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-903/903.jpg,,,,,,,
904,Euclid,2," SCP-904 was discovered scratched on a bathroom wall in the literature department of ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ University, after reports of unusual behavior and difficulty speaking in approximately 300 students and staff.

905,Safe,1," SCP-905 is a sentient entity composed of photons. These photons form a humanoid shape that has been described as “fuzzy, but definite”. It is roughly 1.75 m tall; however, its mass is immeasurable. SCP-905 has shown the ability to speak through the manipulation of air particles, but its mechanism to perform this is unknown.",,,,,,,,
906,Euclid,2," SCP-906 is a writhing mass of dark brown, worm-like invertebrates. These organisms seem to interact in a uniform fashion, forming a colonial ""superorganism"" in a similar manner to army ants. For reasons currently unknown, SCP-906 will usually form its ""body"" into that of a very rough, humanoid figure. SCP-906 is shown to be capable of crude bipedal movement when in this state; however, when travelling longer distances, it will deviate to a flattened mass with a greater efficiency of movement.",,,,,,,,
907,Safe,1," SCP-907 is a 196¦ VW van bearing no internal or external structural anomalies. The vehicle had received a new coat of paint shortly before recovery, but otherwise all modification to the vehicle has been carried out by the Foundation. Said modification includes the removal of all seats in the vehicle and the addition of testing and research equipment.",,,,,,,,
908,Safe,1," SCP-908 is a partially-submerged rocky islet. The exposed rock above the waterline measures approximately 30 meters in length and 25 meters in width, and rises to a height of approximately 22 meters above the waterline. The rock is composed of granite. The vertical rock face contains carved inscriptions in the Old Ge'ez script which are too eroded to be read clearly but appear to indicate that the rock was visited by Ethiopians in the fourth or fifth century BCE. Near the waterline, there are also carved glyphs that resemble the oracle bone script used in Shang-dynasty China, but the weathering of the carvings indicates that they were added relatively recently, probably within the past two centuries. The only macro-organisms inhabiting the islet are various lichens and small mollusks, although portions of the islet are also covered with seabird guano.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/60/Ball%27s_Pyramid_North.jpg/240px-Ball%27s_Pyramid_North.jpg,,,,,,,

No other records of this individual have been located.",,,,,,,,
911,Euclid,2," SCP-911 is a papyrus scroll of The Egyptian Book of the Dead, dating from approximately 1375 BCE. Analysis has not shown any anomalous composition of materials. When a living human makes skin contact with SCP-911, in 90% of cases, their personality, memory, and higher brain functions - ""consciousness"", for lack of a better term - are drawn into the scroll, leaving a body with no higher brain function. Unless kept on life support, affected subjects die of dehydration in approximately 3 days.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-911/911.jpg,,,,,,,
912,Safe,1," SCP-912 consists of several items of police-issue body armour, clothing and equipment that together form a discrete entity capable of independent movement and action. Both the method by which this ability has been acquired and means by which it is achieved have yet to be identified. The elements that comprise SCP-912 conform to the standards of uniform worn by the ¦¦PD SWAT as of ¦¦/20¦¦ (the approximate date of acquisition). Uniform elements float in mid-air as though worn by a man or woman around 185 cm (6'1"") in height, but no such presence can be detected. SCP-912 does not directly respond to communication attempts, but will follow simple orders in English given by personnel wearing the uniform of an officer of the ¦¦PD.",,,,,,,,
913,Euclid,2," SCP-913 appears to be a middle-aged African-American male with an extremely fast metabolism. SCP-913 requires the recommended daily caloric intake for a normal human every 2 hours, and has an internal temperature of [REDACTED].",,,,,,,,
914,Safe,1," SCP-914 is a large clockwork device weighing several tons and covering an area of eighteen square meters, consisting of screw drives, belts, pulleys, gears, springs and other clockwork. It is incredibly complex, consisting of over eight million moving parts comprised mostly of tin and copper, with some wooden and cloth items observed. Observation and probing have showed no electronic assemblies or any form of power other than the “Mainspring” under the “Selection Panel”. Two large booths 3mx2.1mx2.1m (10ftx7ftx7ft) are connected via copper tubes to the main body of SCP-914, labeled “Intake” and “Output”. Between them is a copper panel with a large knob with a small arrow attached. The words Rough, Coarse, 1:1, Fine, and Very Fine are positioned at points around the knob. Below the knob is a large “key” that winds the “mainspring”.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-914/gears.jpg,,,,,,,
915,Euclid,2," SCP-915 is a mechanical computation device with a highly non-Euclidean internal configuration. It was the result of experimentation involving the effect of ¦¦¦-¦¦¦ upon  SCP-914 . Despite appearing entirely mechanical, 915 completely replicates the capabilities of the input device, one (1) HP Slimline S3600F desktop computer. It appears that 915's exceptional topology makes these computational specifications possible. The current theory suggests that extensive outpocketing in space and time allows computations per second that would be associated with a mechanical device to be superseded.",,,,,,,,
916,Safe,1," SCP-916 is an adult, male golden retriever. It is identical to any other dog of its breed, other than its exceptional longevity. 1  Researchers and test subjects report its demeanor to be exceptionally friendly.",,,,,,,,
917,Safe,1," SCP-917 appears to be an elderly Caucasian male. Subject’s facial features appear to degenerate and regenerate in relation to the lunar cycle, completely disappearing during the new moon and normal during the full moon.

921,Euclid,2," SCP-921 is an underground complex of rooms, tunnels and chambers of various sizes, composition and age surrounding a central chamber, located in the mountainous area near ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦ . While some appear to be natural caves, others are clearly man-made, or were formed by unknown means altogether. SCP-921's anomalous nature stems from the effect the assorted objects it contains (henceforth SCP-921-1) have on those who interact with them. Many of the rooms in SCP-921 contain rock formations or underground flora (in the cave-like rooms), mundane items (in the man-made rooms) or other objects (in the unclassified rooms). These objects seem to contain ""sensations"" — when interacted with, each object will cause its user to experience a combination of sights, sounds, scents and other sensory inputs, as well as emotions. No lasting or harmful effects due to interaction with instances of SCP-921-1 were observed.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-921/St_Ninian%27s_Cave_-_entrance.jpg,,,,,,,

928,Euclid-exsequi,6, SCP-928 is a doll made primarily of ceramic and cloth. The eyes of the doll are capable of movement and will usually follow any person in the vicinity. SCP-928 is otherwise physically unremarkable.,https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-928/le-romney-face.jpg,,,,,,,
929,Euclid,2," SCP-929 is an entity of varying height, weight and species, as it possesses the ability to rapidly change its appearance and biology to match those of any other species. Upon entering an area of three meters around an animal organism, SCP-929 will designate said organism as its 'parent' and rapidly transform. SCP-929 will always take the form of a younger member of the organism's species and will remain in this form until either the 'parent' organism is killed or hostilities are engaged against SCP-929.",,,,,,,,
930,Euclid,2," SCP-930 is a  tropical island  located at 22.¦¦¦¦¦¦°S, 134.¦¦¦¦¦¦°W, formerly known as ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ by the local populace. SCP-930 is approximately 710 m in diameter, with a range of 680-760 m, although accurate shoreline measurements are impossible due to manifestation of SCP-930's primary effects. Refuse retrieved during exploration attempts suggest that humans may have once lived on the island. Flora consists primarily of the  Poaceae  and  Meliaceae  families; however, aerial photography of SCP-930's canopy has revealed a number of introduced species also populate the island.",,,,,,,,
,,2,,,,,,,,,
932,Euclid,2," SCP-932 are creatures able to adjust the refractive indices of their bodies in order to appear invisible. This ability seems to be disrupted when SCP-932 is exposed to sound; a loud (100 dB) tone of 510 Hz neutralises it completely. When visible, SCP-932 resemble pale and featureless children. Their height varies from 1.2 to 1.6 m and weigh approximately 30-40 kilograms. In large numbers, SCP-932 have been able to pin down and fully immobilise an adult human.",,,,,,,,
933,Euclid,2, SCP-933-01 appears to be an innocuous roll of duct tape. Attempts to unroll it by non-affected personnel have proved ineffective.,,,,,,,,
934,Euclid,2," SCP-934 is the lighthouse near [DATA EXPUNGED] on the valley property and estate of the late Dr. ¦¦¦¦¦. Dr. ¦¦¦¦¦, a renowned scientist, had the functioning lighthouse built on his property at great expense despite the inland location nearly 65 km from any body of water, citing a need for his ""grand experiment"".",,,,,,,,
935,Euclid,2," SCP-935 is a box of playing cards, appearing to date from pre-1700 Germany, specifically Brandenburg. All cards composing SCP-935 are well worn, but in playable condition.

938,Keter,3," SCP-938 is a predatory electrical entity. The entity appears to exist as electrical potential of intensity similar to that which accompanies a moderate electrical storm; SCP-938 frequently travels with such storms. It enters electrical grids through lightning strikes, often causing a temporary loss of power. Upon infiltrating an electrical grid, SCP-938 typically selects a single occupied structure to monitor. While dormant within power grids, the only known indication of SCP-938's presence are anomalous readings by devices sensitive to electromagnetic fields (see below).",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-938/sprites.jpg,,,,,,,
939,Keter,3," SCP-939 are endothermic, pack-based predators which display atrophy of various systems similar to troglobitic organisms. The skins of SCP-939 are highly permeable to moisture and translucent red, owing to a compound chemically similar to hemoglobin. SCP-939 average 2.2 meters tall standing upright and weigh an average of 250 kg, though weight is highly variable. Each of their four limbs end in three-fingered claws with a fourth, opposable digit, and are covered in setae which considerably augment climbing ability. Their heads are elongated, devoid of even vestigial eyes or eye sockets, and contain no brain casing. The jaws of SCP-939 are lined with red, faintly luminescent fang-like teeth, similar to those belonging to specimens of the genus  Chauliodus , up to 6 cm in length, and encircled by heat-sensitive pit organs. Eye spots, sensitive to light and dark, run the length of their spined dorsal ridges. These spines may be up to 16 cm long and are believed to be sensitive to changes in air pressure and flow.",,,,,,,,
940,Keter,3," SCP-940 is a parasitoid organism with some superficial similarities to troglobitic members of the class Arachnida. Adult specimens are highly agile and possess leg spans from four to seven meters; due to the difficulty in separating SCP-940 from their hosts (see below), average weight and body size are moot considerations. Each of their eight translucent legs is dotted regularly with six types of specialized sensory organs—IR-sensitive pit organs; ampullae of Lorenzini; compound and non-compound eyes sensitive to UV; and two additional organs of indeterminate function—and end in large tarsal claws, possessing scopulae and setules common amongst species of hunting spiders and allowing them to climb sheer vertical surfaces with ease. SCP-940 possess a radial nerve net similar to Asteroidea, or the common starfish, and no central nervous system; the possibility that SCP-940 rely on their host's brainpower for processing of external stimuli cannot be ruled out at this time.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-940/940-1-new.jpg,,,,,,,
941,Euclid,2," SCP-941 is a viral phenomenon affecting gasoline-powered automobiles designed for human transportation. Infected machines will indicate a variety of malfunctions, typically manifesting over a period of three to five days, then fading over a similar timeframe.

,,2," SCP-942-1 are colored gumballs of standard (2.53cm) size. From the moment an instance of SCP-942-1 is ingested, the consumer's bodily fluids will take on the appearance of blood upon leaving the subject's body. The fluids will coagulate like normal blood and are indistinguishable from blood by sight, smell, or touch. However, observation by means other than the aforementioned, such as chemical analysis or infrared spectroscopy, will indicate the original substance. Other than coagulation the fluids show no anomalous reactions or chemical processes. The subject's actual blood, and the properties of bodily fluids while remaining inside the body appear to be unaffected. The nasal cavity and the surface of the eye are not entirely free from the effect, resulting in the appearance of blood-shot eyes, tears of blood, and a constant low-intensity nosebleed in affected subjects. Regions prone to sweating such as toes or armpits will be covered near-perpetually in crusts of dried blood, and affected subjects have reported considerable discomfort during urination.",,,,,,,,
943,Safe,1," SCP-943 is a band of unidentified metal, adjustable through a sliding mechanism to become anywhere from 5cm in diameter, to 38cm in diameter. The band bears inscribings along its outside surface reading in English: ""That Justice may flow like water"". When placed onto a human subject's arm, the device appears to induce visual, auditory, and tactile hallucinations in a staggered pattern. In all cases, the hallucinations appear to be of an event that is connected to the subject in some way. Invariably, the subject is connected in a way that makes them the aggressor, and in the induced hallucinations, the subject assumes the role of victim. All recorded hallucinations have been of conflict, and are documented in Experiment Log 943-1 through Experiment Log 943-3.",,,,,,,,
944,Euclid,2," SCP-944 is a single-story building outfitted as a “mirror maze,” formerly an attraction at ¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦ Amusement Park in ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦, ¦¦¦¦¦¦.

945,Euclid,2," SCP-945 is a rough wooden Egyptian  shawabti  box dating from approximately 1500-1300 BCE, currently holding 186 clay  shawabti  figures which have been recently sculpted, designated SCP-945-2 to SCP-945-187. When the Foundation became aware of SCP-945 there was only a single ancient figurine within the box, designated SCP-945-1. In addition to the obvious age of SCP-945-1, it is distinct for being the only figure that bears any inscriptions. As the box was originally designed to hold a full set of 401 figurines, it is theorized that some of the originals may still exist outside of containment.",,,,,,,,
,Euclid,2," SCP-946 is a wooden table with two accompanying chairs. At unpredictable intervals, ranging from 2 to 4 times per week, two men will appear (designated SCP-946-1 and SCP-946-2), taking the two seats. SCP-946-1 and SCP-946-2 will then have a civil argument or debate about a random subject. The topic of these arguments has varied from existential concepts to trivial and mundane subjects. In some circumstances, these debates have focused on a hypothetical event, and the merits of its occurrence. In these cases, the outcome of the argument manifests itself in reality. At any time during the debate, an outside observer may join the debate, with a new chair appearing at the table and the dimensions of the table altering to fit all parties. Should any of the ""guests"" make an  ad hominem  argument or make an intentionally false or misleading statement, SCP-946-1 will criticize them. If they continue, SCP-946-1 will state that they are no longer welcome in the debate, at which point their chair will disappear. Any further attempts for this subject to communicate with SCP-946-1 or -2 will be ignored.",,,,,,,,
947,Keter,3," SCP-947 is a contagious, memetic expletive defined by its creator as meaning ""a really fake, annoying person or thing that you wish would just naff off already"" [sic] . Any English speaker who hears or reads SCP-947 will automatically understand its definition, know the name of its creator, and begin to incorporate it into their vocabulary. Over time, affected individuals will gradually replace all expletives in their vocabulary with SCP-947.",,,,,,,,
948,Safe,1," SCP-948 is Seamus Ó Tuathail, a former surgeon in the Mater Hospital, Dublin. SCP-948 has been continuously lecturing on a variety of medical subjects in the Pythagoras Theatre, Trinity College Dublin, since July 4th, 1984. SCP-948 shows an anomalous healing effect, with physically injured subjects introduced to its lecture theatre healing if it discusses relevant medical procedures. This healing effect does not seem to be any more effective than traditional medicine, but can offer improvement when used in conjunction 1 . SCP-948 does not display any healing effect with injuries or illnesses it is not familiar with. Beginning 01/01/2015, a reading list of textbooks and medical papers has been provided to SCP-948 to keep it up to date with modern medicine, which has shown a marked increase in its healing ability 2 .",,,,,,,,

The glitch has been found in approximately 1 out of every 3 cartridges; however, there does not appear to be any recognizable pattern found among the affected cartridges. Uploaded ROM image files of affected copies of SCP-951-1 do appear to have the same anomalous properties as physical cartridges.",,,,,,,,
952,Keter,3," SCP-952 is an anomalous subgenre of math rock known as ""NP Rock"", defined primarily by a specific arrangement of instrumental configurations, subject matter, and esoteric musical technique. Evidence suggests that the culmination of these components is the cause of SCP-952's anomalous properties.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-952/HighwayAsh.png,,,,,,,
953,Keter,3," SCP-953 is a female Red Fox ( Vulpes vulpes ) approximately 8 kg in weight, with a spine that splits around the 26th vertebra into nine separate tails. Subject displays  polymorphic  properties, however, allowing it to take the form of various other objects and beings (most commonly, an attractive Korean female). 1  Subject will display some vulpine aspect (ears, tail, paws, eyes, fur, voice, mannerisms) in all of its alternate forms: this can serve to identify the subject should it attempt disguise, although SCP-953 will attempt to conceal its tails through clothing and other methods.",,,,,,,,
954,,2," SCP-954 is a species of frog similar to  Eleutherodactylus cystignathoides campi  also known as the Rio Grande Chirping frog.

956,,5," SCP-956 appears to be a common piñata, resembling an unknown quadruped. Tests have revealed that, although superficially similar to paper-mache, SCP-956 is constructed of various amounts of glue, ¦¦¦¦¦, sugar, an unidentified fur, and human tissue. SCP-956 has also shown to be highly resistant to any sort of bludgeoning damage, with large amounts of crushing force showing no damage to its structural integrity, though the use of gunfire as well as heat and flame have shown to be effective.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-956/tumblr_lnkjqq3osj1qzzmx1o1_500.jpg,,,,,,,
957,Keter,3," SCP-957 is a humanoid entity currently residing within a house in ¦¦¦¦¦¦, Kentucky. This organism measures approximately 2m in height and 75kg in weight and appears to be devoid of internal organs, as observed via a large opening on its ventral torso. Furthermore, it does not appear to require sleep or nourishment. Interaction with personnel has shown that the entity is capable of speech and is fluent in English, but prefers to talk in a currently unknown language. It is not openly hostile towards Foundation personnel, yet often refuses to cooperate with interviews and testing. Attempts to restrain SCP-957 for these purposes have proven ineffective due to the entity’s disproportionate level of strength.",,,,,,,,
958,Safe,1," SCP-958-A is a humanoid toy robot, composed primarily of plastic and tin. SCP-958-A is nineteen centimeters tall and has a mass of 214.8 grams.

965,Euclid,2," SCP-965 is a visual manifestation that occurs within framed windows. This manifestation takes the shape of the shadowed face of an apparently pale-skinned male that is looking through the window. The exact details shown vary, as does the direction of orientation as well as the age of the person; however, sufficient detail shows it to consistently be the same being at differing points of its life, between the approximate ages of 10 and 55. Research into an individual matching SCP-965 has thus far proven inconclusive.",,,,,,,,
966,Euclid,2," SCP-966 are predatory creatures that resemble hairless, digitigrade humans, possessing an elongated face with a mouth lined with needle-like teeth. On each hand, they have five claws that can be up to 20 cm long. Although sharp, these are easily broken, making them unfit for combat. SCP-966's height ranges from 1.4 to 1.6 meters, and they can reach up to 30 kg in weight. Physically, SCP-966 are weak, possessing hollow bones and low muscular density.

SCP-980 does not possess any facial characteristics, sensory organs, or features such as nails and hair. It is injured with relative ease, bleeding a viscous substance that appears similar to white paint. Analysis shows that SCP-980 possesses no internal organs, though it does have a skeletal structure comparable to that of a human. Despite the absence of eyes and ears, SCP-980 appears to display 20/20 vision and slightly above-average hearing. Extensive testing has not explained this, though no abnormalities or anything to suggest other methods of sensory capability have been shown. SCP-980 is able to write in English when prompted, though typing is inefficient due to its influence quickly rendering the keys as well as the monitor unresponsive.",,,,,,,,

SCP-981-1 is a steel film canister dating from the late 1920s, with signs of damage concomitant with its apparent age. It is labelled in Spanish as having been copied by the Buenos Aires Cinematographic Laboratory, with the handwritten title ‘236 - Metropolis’. Other writing on the label is too worn to read, but appears to be a name and a short note in a different handwriting. Inside the canister is SCP-981-2, a reel spooled with Kodak Panchromatic nitrate film, on which is a 16mm reduction negative of the 1927 Fritz Lang film  Metropolis . The film and the canister it was found in show no unusual markings or indications that they are anything other than a mass-produced stock for distribution to cinemas in the late 1920s.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-981/981-2.jpg,,,,,,,
982,Safe,1," SCP-982 is an antique casement window, recovered from a Marshall, Carter, and Dark auction, and originally taken from the abandoned business offices of ¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦, a 19th-century patent attorney in Chicago, IL. No matter where it is mounted, SCP-982 opens onto the street outside ¦¦¦ ¦¦¦¦¦¦'s third-story office, as it was between 8:30 AM on Friday, March 26, 1875 and 10:45 AM on Saturday, March 27, 1875. Personnel exiting this window find themselves in what is apparently 1875 Chicago; however, at the end of the 26-hour interval, the city 'resets'. Any external objects or personnel within the city at that time are lost.",,,,,,,,
983,Safe,1," SCP-983 is a vintage mechanical monkey with a faded date located on the bottom of the left foot, placing its manufacture at some point in the 1940s by an unknown person or company. The monkey is dressed in the remains of what used to be a popular vest design for circus ringmasters. In the monkey’s left hand, there is a lightly tarnished brass bell. In the right hand, the monkey holds a small brass striking rod. The monkey is capable of emitting speech and sound, although examination of the object has revealed no seams, screws, or openings that would indicate a method of disassembly.",,,,,,,,
984,Safe-impetus,2," SCP-984 is a restroom located in [REDACTED]. Upon recovery, three light bulbs were found smashed.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-984/bearstormstheshitter.jpg,,,,,,,
985,"Euclid,",3," SCP-985 is a conveyor baggage claim, located within Terminal ¦¦ of the [REDACTED] International Airport. According to construction records, SCP-985 was installed at the same time as all other baggage claims in that terminal, and reviews of maintenance reports has failed to produce any leads regarding the unusual properties exhibited by SCP-985. While all sections are kept under observation, SCP-985 operates indistinguishably from any other baggage claim in the terminal, and the amount of electricity drawn by the machine remains relatively constant.",,,,,,,,
986,Safe,1," SCP-986 is an unpublished manuscript entitled  The Absent Willows , likely written by American novelist William Faulkner. The manuscript consists of 1208 bound pages, containing an original work of fiction and a supplementary section. No references to it were made by Faulkner in any of his personal correspondence, nor has it been cited by literary scholars as being among possible unpublished works of the author.",,,,,,,,
987,Euclid,2, SCP-987 is a collection of mirrors (SCP-987-a through  h  m) and an anomalous entity (SCP-987-1) that is only directly detectable by thermographic scans.,,,,,,,,
988,Safe,1, SCP-988 is an unopenable wooden chest.,https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-988/WoodenChest.jpg,,,,,,,
989,Safe,1," SCP-989 is a compound of C 12 H 22 O 11  (Sucrose) interlaced with a substance with the chemical formula H 7 Xe 2 O 4 C 8 . The method by which this molecule was created is currently unknown, as the current principles of chemistry disagree with its composition and structure. Research is ongoing.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-989/Sugar_caster_MET_145033.jpg,,,,,,,
990,Keter,3," SCP-990 is generally a human male dressed in a Cold War era business suit who appears to Foundation personnel through dreams. Thus far no Foundation personnel have encountered SCP-990 in the real world; if he corresponds to an actual human being, we have yet to find him. Presently there have been no reports of SCP-990 appearing to non-Foundation personnel.",http://scp-wiki.wikidot.com/local--files/scp-990/scp990-new.jpg,,,,,,,
991,Safe,1," SCP-991-1 is a 19 cm long syringe. While the plunger is made of steel, the barrel and needle appear to be composed of previously unknown materials. When inserted into the blood vessel of a human and drawn, SCP-991-1 fills with an unknown black fluid, given the designation SCP-991-2. Once drawn from an individual (henceforth known as the donor), the plunger of the syringe cannot be pressed unless the needle of SCP-991-1 has been inserted into another human. Visual analysis of SCP-991-2 has shown it to have a significantly lower viscosity than blood, but direct analysis has proven impossible, due to the nature of SCP-991-1. Attempts to draw SCP-991-2 from a vein using a normal needle immediately after it was injected with SCP-991-1 have met with failure; apparently SCP-991-2 either disperses the instant it is injected or becomes immaterial.",,,,,,,,

993,Safe,1," SCP-993 is a children's television program entitled ""Bobble the Clown"" which first began airing in ¦¦/¦¦/19¦¦. SCP-993 seems to have been made in the style of an educational cartoon, with the primary plot of most episodes being the titular character, Bobble the Clown, learning a new skill or activity. The program appears to have no supporting cast and the setting of the program often changes between episodes.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-993/993.png,,,,,,,
994,Euclid,2," SCP-994 is a species of airborne lifeform bearing no resemblance to any known phylum of organism. SCP-994 are generally circular, with a flat ventral surface and curved dorsal side, and measuring between 3 and 50 meters in diameter (9.84 and 164 ft, respectively) when fully grown. SCP-994 will change in shape with age: juveniles will appear as blunted triangles, adults will be saucer-shaped, and elderly SCP-994 will be oblong.",,,,,,,,
995,Euclid,2," SCP-995 is an organism with traits that vary between those of fungi and those of animals. SCP-995's life cycle starts with it being a spore. The spore stays dormant until it finds an area that has low light and is moist. However, an SCP-995 spore has more probability of activating under artificial structures such as household furniture; leather, vinyl, and polyester seem to be favored. There, the spore will grow into a soft organic mass which feeds off microorganisms in the air. It will continue to grow, sprouting appendages enabling it to move. A mouth will soon form, along with teeth and a simple digestive tract. SCP-995 in its mature stage feeds on larger organisms such as insects and rodents. The specimen will then start generating more instances of SCP-995 via the reproduction of spores. SCP-995 has been known to reach the size of [DATA REDACTED] in diameter. Infants have become prey, along with household pets. If a large population of SCP-995 has spawned in a small area, SCP-995 will start to migrate, having the capabilities of infesting an average house by the hundreds in a few days.",,,,,,,,
996,Euclid,2," SCP-996 is a sheet of sheer gray fabric. Under no stress, it takes the shape of a circle with a 0.5 meter diameter. The fabric seems to be infinitely elastic, as it will stretch under small amounts of force, and large amounts fail to rupture it. Attempts to puncture SCP-996 result in it deforming around the puncture implement. Shear forces will cause elastic deformation, but do not tear the material. Thus, SCP-996 seems to be topologically ideal.",,,,,,,,
997,Safe,1," SCP-997 is a device superficially resembling a lamp, but without a bulb and with a twisting wire structure in place of a shade, believed to function as an antenna. It is made primarily of metal, and was somewhat corroded when contained, though this does not appear to have affected its functionality. Imaging of the internal workings suggests sophisticated electronics of unknown purpose. There is a switch near the top that controls whether or not the device is active. SCP-997 is powered by a standard NEMA 5 power outlet, and so has been fitted with an adapter for Site 19 testing chamber wall outlets. While disconnected from power or turned off, SCP-997 exhibits no anomalous properties.",,,,,,,,
998,Euclid,2," SCP-998 is a MC-130E ""Combat Talon"" military transport formerly assigned to the United States Air Force 8th Special Operations Squadron with tail number ¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ and call sign ""Blackbird One-Niner"". SCP-998 disappeared without a trace on ¦/¦¦/73 during a covert operation near [DATA EXPUNGED] along with five (5) crew members, three (3) passengers, and a classified cargo. Originally believed to have crashed under adverse weather conditions, a search for the wreckage of SCP-998 was conducted and called off three months later with no results.",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-998/scp998.jpg,,,,,,,
999,Safe,1," SCP-999 appears to be a large, amorphous, gelatinous mass of translucent orange slime, weighing about 54 kg (120 lbs) with a consistency similar to that of peanut butter. Subject’s size and shape is easily malleable and can change shape at will, though when at rest, SCP-999 becomes a rounded, oblate dome roughly 2 meters wide and 1 meter in height. The surface of SCP-999 consists of a thin, transparent membrane similar to that of an animal cell roughly .5 cm thick, and is highly elastic, allowing SCP-999 to flatten portions of its body up to 2 cm thin. This surface is also hydrophobic, although SCP-999 can willfully absorb liquids (see Addendum SCP-999-A). The rest of SCP-999's body is filled with a viscous orange substance of unknown chemical makeup, though it is capable of digesting organic materials with ease.",,,,,,,,
1000,Keter,3," SCP-1000 is a nocturnal, omnivorous ape, classified in the  Hominini  branch along with genera  Pan  and  Homo . Adults range in size from 1.5 to 3 m (5 to 10 ft) in height, and weigh between 90 and 270 kg (200 - 600 lbs). They have grey, brown, black, red, and occasionally white fur. They possess large eyes with good vision, a pronounced brow ridge, and a sagittal crest on the forehead similar to that of the gorilla, but present in both sexes. Their intelligence is on par with that of  Pan troglodytes  (the common chimpanzee).",https://scp-wiki.wdfiles.com/local--files/scp-1000/bigfoot_patterson01-new.png,,,,,,,
